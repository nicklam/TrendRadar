On Monday, the Senate confirmed President Donald Trump’s latest Fed appointee, Stephen Miran, a senior White House economist. “He will have just enough time to get his Fed ID badge, figure out where the restrooms are, and cast his vote,” noted Ian Katz, policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners. Katz called it the “strangest FOMC meeting ever,” given Trump’s ongoing legal battle to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook.&lt;br/&gt;Trump sought to fire Cook on allegations of falsifying mortgage documents, but a federal judge blocked the dismissal last week, and an appeals court ruled against Trump on Monday.&lt;br/&gt;While markets do not expect a 50-basis-point cut, analysts anticipate the Fed will discuss the option and possibly see dissenting votes. Trump appointees Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who dissented at the last meeting, could again push for a deeper cut. Deutsche Bank’s Matthew Luzzetti wrote that if Miran joins them, it would mark the first time since 1988 that three Governors dissented at a single meeting.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, some Fed officials may favor holding rates steady, further highlighting divisions within the FOMC.</a>

He argued for abandoning attempts to change the statement language in a more consensus-oriented direction as it became clear that the three weren’t going to support the decision. “There’s little reason to accommodate them,” he said, according to transcripts of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;The Fed chair succession &quot;beauty contest&quot; being stage-managed by the Treasury secretary is heightening the tradeoff between political signaling and inside-the-boardroom sway.</a>

Futures are down 0.5% to $3,706.50 a troy ounce after settling at $3,725.10 in the previous session, while the dollar index trades 0.2% higher at 96.82.Investors expect the U.S. central bank to cut rates by 25 basis points, though attention will focus on Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#x27;s remarks for cues on the pace of future monetary easing. &quot;Markets have priced a deep easing path, leaving them vulnerable to disappointment if the Fed underdelivers,&quot; says Pepperstone&#x27;s Ahmad Assiri.

The Fed’s dual mandate—low inflation and a healthy labor market—has created tension in decision-making. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Core Inflation&lt;/b&gt;: Predicted to rise to 3.1% by the end of 2025, with expectations for a gradual decline to 2.6% by the end of 2026. Inflation is not expected to return to the Fed’s 2% target until 2028. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Economic Context&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Growth Projections&lt;/b&gt;: Officials forecast 1.6% economic growth for 2025, slightly higher than their June estimates. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Tariff Impact&lt;/b&gt;: Higher tariffs, largely paid by importers, are causing one-time price increases but have had slower-than-expected pass-through effects on inflation. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Labor Force Constraints&lt;/b&gt;: Trump’s immigration crackdown has reduced the supply of workers, contributing to the labor market slowdown. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal Divisions&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Dissenting Votes&lt;/b&gt;: Miran’s vote for a half-point cut highlights divisions within the Fed. Seven of the 19 policymakers projected fewer rate cuts for 2025, suggesting future decisions may be contentious. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Dot Plot&lt;/b&gt;: Projections for 2025 varied widely, with one policymaker favoring rates to remain at 4.25%-4.5% and another suggesting a steep drop to 2.75%-3%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Remarks&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Risk Management&lt;/b&gt;: Powell described the rate cut as a risk management move, aimed at supporting the economy rather than responding to an economic downturn. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Focus on Labor Market&lt;/b&gt;: Powell emphasized the Fed’s shift toward addressing labor market risks, noting that persistent inflation risks have declined. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Independence&lt;/b&gt;: Powell reiterated the Fed’s commitment to political independence, stating, “Everything we do is in service to our public mission.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Future Rate Path&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Two More Cuts Expected&lt;/b&gt;: Most officials predict two additional quarter-point cuts this year, bringing rates down to 3.5%-3.75%. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Long-Term Outlook&lt;/b&gt;: Rates are expected to decline slightly in 2026 and stabilize just above 3% through 2028.</a>

After holding rates steady through 2025 following last year&#x27;s 100bp cut, the Fed&#x27;s stance shifted at July&#x27;s FOMC meeting when officials acknowledged a weakening jobs market justified policy loosening, with Chair Powell confirming at Jackson Hole that economic changes may soon &quot;warrant&quot; lower rates. Labor market deterioration is the key driver, as Q2&#x27;s 3.3% GDP growth masked consumer weakness with spending plateauing due to household concerns over tariffs, cooling employment, and wealth volatility. The latest Fed Beige Book confirmed this narrative, reporting little economic activity change and flat-to-declining consumer spending across districts, with 11 of 12 regions showing no hiring over seven weeks. While inflation remains above target due to tariff impacts, the Fed recognizes it needs to move policy closer to neutral without waiting for full confirmation in data. Though a 50bp cut remains possible given jobs deterioration, majority of members caution regarding tariff-induced inflation makes 25bp the most likely outcome, aligning with market expectations.</a>

Here’s the breakdown:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. The “Dovish Cut” — Most Likely (47.5% chance)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fed slashes rates by 25 bps and issue dovish language.&lt;br/&gt;Immediate reaction: S&amp;P 500 pops +1% to ~6,650.&lt;br/&gt;But beware: JPMorgan warns a &lt;b&gt;sell-the-news slide&lt;/b&gt; could drag stocks down as much as &lt;b&gt;5%&lt;/b&gt; in the weeks ahead.&lt;br/&gt;Buying opportunities if that happens:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mega-cap tech &amp; AI names&lt;/b&gt; — JPMorgan stays overweight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt; — poised to benefit if rate expectations and 10Y yields fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The “Hawkish Cut” — Second Likeliest (40% chance)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fed delivers the expected 25 bps cut but signals hawkish concerns.&lt;br/&gt;S&amp;P 500 likely stalls or dips -0.5%.&lt;br/&gt;Powell could hint that the&lt;b&gt; job market is now a bigger worry than inflation&lt;/b&gt;, undercutting the rally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. The “Shock and Awe” Scenarios — Low Odds, High Volatility (11.5% chance)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;No cut (4%)&lt;/b&gt;: Stocks sink 1%-2%, pushing the S&amp;P 500 toward 6,450.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jumbo cut of 50 bps (7.5%)&lt;/b&gt;: Market chaos — S&amp;P 500 could&lt;b&gt; swing ±1.5%&lt;/b&gt; depending on how investors read the move.</a>

However, the risks of that repeating are limited this time around, says the head of fixed income. Despite some valid arguments, the current starting point offers more cushion against such a development and risks are more limited at this point, Messi says. The 10-year Treasury yield is currently higher than it was in Sept. 2024 when the Fed started its rate cuts.</a>

Improving earnings fundamentals have also been a key driver of recently strong Asian equities, they say, with U.S. trade deals leading to higher year-ahead earnings estimates in most Asian markets. Asian markets&#x27; main risks would be if the median 2026 Fed Funds rate dot remains unchanged or if Powell downplays the outlook for cuts, they add.</a>

The S&amp;P 500 was little changed at 9:45 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 struggled to maintain a small advance. A close higher would mark the benchmark’s 10th straight gain, its longest winning streak since November 2021.&lt;br/&gt;Among individual movers, Oracle rose after CBS News reported it is part of a consortium that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a potential framework deal. Tesla advanced even as U.S. auto safety regulators launched an investigation into possible defects with some vehicle doors.&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales climbed 0.6% in August, following a similar gain in July, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Excluding autos, sales increased 0.7%. Nine of 13 categories rose, underscoring resilient consumer spending and beating all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.</a>

Here&#x27;s What to Watch】Eyes on Powell as the rate decision drops—will dissenters shake up the dot plot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fed Decision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s closely monitored press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. Investors are hoping the central bank will cut rates for the first time this year.&lt;br/&gt;- Traders think a rate cut is in the bag. Fed funds futures are pricing in a 100% likelihood of at least a quarter-point decrease today, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.&lt;br/&gt;- Powell’s commentary and the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, which includes a key grid known as the “dot plot,” should provide clues into the future of monetary policy.&lt;br/&gt;- Fed Governor Lisa Cook will get to vote after an appeals court blocked President Donald Trump from firing her ahead of the meeting. Governor Stephen Miran will also get a say following his Senate confirmation on Monday.&lt;br/&gt;- Mortgage rates dropped to a three-year low ahead of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tech Moves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Microsoft announced plans to spend $30 billion on infrastructure and operations tied to artificial intelligence in the country. Nvidia, Google, OpenAI and Salesforce all also said they would each make multi-billion dollar investments in the U.K.&lt;br/&gt;- Meta is set to unveil its most advanced smart glasses to date at its annual Connect event. The glasses, internally called Hypernova, are expected to cost $800.&lt;br/&gt;- Nvidia shares dipped more than 1.3% in the premarket after The Financial Times reported, citing sources, that China has banned tech companies in the country from buying Nvidia’s chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Policy Watch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Trump yesterday extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok’s U.S. business until December. If that sentence feels familiar, it’s because it’s the fourth such extension the president has granted for the popular short-form video app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Economic Data Release&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- US housing starts declined last month to the weakest level since May, as elevated home inventories curbed builders’ willingness to expand output. New residential construction fell 8.5% to an annualized pace of 1.31 million units.</a>

The Fed’s dual mandate—low inflation and a healthy labor market—has created tension in decision-making. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Core Inflation&lt;/b&gt;: Predicted to rise to 3.1% by the end of 2025, with expectations for a gradual decline to 2.6% by the end of 2026. Inflation is not expected to return to the Fed’s 2% target until 2028. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Economic Context&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Growth Projections&lt;/b&gt;: Officials forecast 1.6% economic growth for 2025, slightly higher than their June estimates. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Tariff Impact&lt;/b&gt;: Higher tariffs, largely paid by importers, are causing one-time price increases but have had slower-than-expected pass-through effects on inflation. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Labor Force Constraints&lt;/b&gt;: Trump’s immigration crackdown has reduced the supply of workers, contributing to the labor market slowdown. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal Divisions&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Dissenting Votes&lt;/b&gt;: Miran’s vote for a half-point cut highlights divisions within the Fed. Seven of the 19 policymakers projected fewer rate cuts for 2025, suggesting future decisions may be contentious. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Dot Plot&lt;/b&gt;: Projections for 2025 varied widely, with one policymaker favoring rates to remain at 4.25%-4.5% and another suggesting a steep drop to 2.75%-3%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Remarks&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Risk Management&lt;/b&gt;: Powell described the rate cut as a risk management move, aimed at supporting the economy rather than responding to an economic downturn. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Focus on Labor Market&lt;/b&gt;: Powell emphasized the Fed’s shift toward addressing labor market risks, noting that persistent inflation risks have declined. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Independence&lt;/b&gt;: Powell reiterated the Fed’s commitment to political independence, stating, “Everything we do is in service to our public mission.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Future Rate Path&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Two More Cuts Expected&lt;/b&gt;: Most officials predict two additional quarter-point cuts this year, bringing rates down to 3.5%-3.75%. &lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Long-Term Outlook&lt;/b&gt;: Rates are expected to decline slightly in 2026 and stabilize just above 3% through 2028.</a>
