Futures are down 0.5% to $3,706.50 a troy ounce after settling at $3,725.10 in the previous session, while the dollar index trades 0.2% higher at 96.82.Investors expect the U.S. central bank to cut rates by 25 basis points, though attention will focus on Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#x27;s remarks for cues on the pace of future monetary easing. &quot;Markets have priced a deep easing path, leaving them vulnerable to disappointment if the Fed underdelivers,&quot; says Pepperstone&#x27;s Ahmad Assiri. Meanwhile, retail sales rose for a third straight month in August, revealing healthy levels of spending despite concerns about lingering inflation and a weakening job market.</a>

After holding rates steady through 2025 following last year&#x27;s 100bp cut, the Fed&#x27;s stance shifted at July&#x27;s FOMC meeting when officials acknowledged a weakening jobs market justified policy loosening, with Chair Powell confirming at Jackson Hole that economic changes may soon &quot;warrant&quot; lower rates. Labor market deterioration is the key driver, as Q2&#x27;s 3.3% GDP growth masked consumer weakness with spending plateauing due to household concerns over tariffs, cooling employment, and wealth volatility. The latest Fed Beige Book confirmed this narrative, reporting little economic activity change and flat-to-declining consumer spending across districts, with 11 of 12 regions showing no hiring over seven weeks. While inflation remains above target due to tariff impacts, the Fed recognizes it needs to move policy closer to neutral without waiting for full confirmation in data. Though a 50bp cut remains possible given jobs deterioration, majority of members caution regarding tariff-induced inflation makes 25bp the most likely outcome, aligning with market expectations.</a>

Here’s the breakdown:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. The “Dovish Cut” — Most Likely (47.5% chance)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fed slashes rates by 25 bps and issue dovish language.&lt;br/&gt;Immediate reaction: S&amp;P 500 pops +1% to ~6,650.&lt;br/&gt;But beware: JPMorgan warns a &lt;b&gt;sell-the-news slide&lt;/b&gt; could drag stocks down as much as &lt;b&gt;5%&lt;/b&gt; in the weeks ahead.&lt;br/&gt;Buying opportunities if that happens:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mega-cap tech &amp; AI names&lt;/b&gt; — JPMorgan stays overweight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt; — poised to benefit if rate expectations and 10Y yields fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The “Hawkish Cut” — Second Likeliest (40% chance)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fed delivers the expected 25 bps cut but signals hawkish concerns.&lt;br/&gt;S&amp;P 500 likely stalls or dips -0.5%.&lt;br/&gt;Powell could hint that the&lt;b&gt; job market is now a bigger worry than inflation&lt;/b&gt;, undercutting the rally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. The “Shock and Awe” Scenarios — Low Odds, High Volatility (11.5% chance)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;No cut (4%)&lt;/b&gt;: Stocks sink 1%-2%, pushing the S&amp;P 500 toward 6,450.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jumbo cut of 50 bps (7.5%)&lt;/b&gt;: Market chaos — S&amp;P 500 could&lt;b&gt; swing ±1.5%&lt;/b&gt; depending on how investors read the move.</a>

He argued for abandoning attempts to change the statement language in a more consensus-oriented direction as it became clear that the three weren’t going to support the decision. “There’s little reason to accommodate them,” he said, according to transcripts of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;The Fed chair succession &quot;beauty contest&quot; being stage-managed by the Treasury secretary is heightening the tradeoff between political signaling and inside-the-boardroom sway.</a>

However, the risks of that repeating are limited this time around, says the head of fixed income. Despite some valid arguments, the current starting point offers more cushion against such a development and risks are more limited at this point, Messi says. The 10-year Treasury yield is currently higher than it was in Sept. 2024 when the Fed started its rate cuts.</a>

On Monday, the Senate confirmed President Donald Trump’s latest Fed appointee, Stephen Miran, a senior White House economist. “He will have just enough time to get his Fed ID badge, figure out where the restrooms are, and cast his vote,” noted Ian Katz, policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners. Katz called it the “strangest FOMC meeting ever,” given Trump’s ongoing legal battle to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook.&lt;br/&gt;Trump sought to fire Cook on allegations of falsifying mortgage documents, but a federal judge blocked the dismissal last week, and an appeals court ruled against Trump on Monday.&lt;br/&gt;While markets do not expect a 50-basis-point cut, analysts anticipate the Fed will discuss the option and possibly see dissenting votes. Trump appointees Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who dissented at the last meeting, could again push for a deeper cut. Deutsche Bank’s Matthew Luzzetti wrote that if Miran joins them, it would mark the first time since 1988 that three Governors dissented at a single meeting.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, some Fed officials may favor holding rates steady, further highlighting divisions within the FOMC.</a>

The S&amp;P 500 was little changed at 9:45 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 struggled to maintain a small advance. A close higher would mark the benchmark’s 10th straight gain, its longest winning streak since November 2021.&lt;br/&gt;Among individual movers, Oracle rose after CBS News reported it is part of a consortium that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a potential framework deal. Tesla advanced even as U.S. auto safety regulators launched an investigation into possible defects with some vehicle doors.&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales climbed 0.6% in August, following a similar gain in July, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Excluding autos, sales increased 0.7%. Nine of 13 categories rose, underscoring resilient consumer spending and beating all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.</a>

The machine, which uses immersion technology similar to ASML’s, is capable of producing 7nm chips using multi-patterning techniques and potentially 5nm chips at lower yields, though it remains far behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), which will begin mass production of 2nm chips using ASML’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) equipment this year. While most components in Yuliangsheng’s machine are made domestically, some parts are still sourced internationally, with plans to fully localize production in the future. SMIC’s trials show promising early results, but mass production could take years, as stability and yield adjustments typically require at least a year. Meanwhile, Shenzhen-based SiCarrier, a shareholder of Yuliangsheng, has unveiled advanced chipmaking equipment and is dedicating resources to developing EUV machines under its “Mount Everest” project, though these efforts remain in early stages. Chinese chipmakers aim to triple output by 2026, primarily relying on earlier-stocked ASML DUV machines, while domestic tools are expected to start mass production around 2027.</a>
