1. 【 Nick Timiraos: This is going to be an interesting meeting to see how Powell threads the needle】This is going to be an interesting meeting to see how Powell threads the needle—via the consensus-oriented policy statement—at a time when disagreements over the rate outlook are more stark. <br/>Would-be Fed dissenters face their own dilemma: A dissent makes a big statement (especially if there's several), but dissenters potentially surrender influence over the market-moving FOMC statement.<br/>This institutional practice was captured by then-Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren during a contentious 2011 meeting where three officials opposed the majority’s decision to provide more economic stimulus. He argued for abandoning attempts to change the statement language in a more consensus-oriented direction as it became clear that the three weren’t going to support the decision. “There’s little reason to accommodate them,” he said, according to transcripts of the meeting.<br/>The Fed chair succession "beauty contest" being stage-managed by the Treasury secretary is heightening the tradeoff between political signaling and inside-the-boardroom sway.

2. 【Gold Slips But Holds Close to All-Time Highs Ahead of Fed Rate Decision: Pepperstone】Gold prices slip in early trade on profit-taking pressures and a firmer U.S. dollar, but continue to hold near record highs ahead of the Fed's policy decision later on Wednesday. Futures are down 0.5% to $3,706.50 a troy ounce after settling at $3,725.10 in the previous session, while the dollar index trades 0.2% higher at 96.82.Investors expect the U.S. central bank to cut rates by 25 basis points, though attention will focus on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks for cues on the pace of future monetary easing. "Markets have priced a deep easing path, leaving them vulnerable to disappointment if the Fed underdelivers," says Pepperstone's Ahmad Assiri. Meanwhile, retail sales rose for a third straight month in August, revealing healthy levels of spending despite concerns about lingering inflation and a weakening job market.

3. 【Fed Set to Resume Its Path Towards 3%: ING】ING anticipates the Fed will cut rates 25bp tonight and deliver 75bp total cuts through March 2026, as labor market weakness now outweighs inflation concerns. After holding rates steady through 2025 following last year's 100bp cut, the Fed's stance shifted at July's FOMC meeting when officials acknowledged a weakening jobs market justified policy loosening, with Chair Powell confirming at Jackson Hole that economic changes may soon "warrant" lower rates. Labor market deterioration is the key driver, as Q2's 3.3% GDP growth masked consumer weakness with spending plateauing due to household concerns over tariffs, cooling employment, and wealth volatility. The latest Fed Beige Book confirmed this narrative, reporting little economic activity change and flat-to-declining consumer spending across districts, with 11 of 12 regions showing no hiring over seven weeks. While inflation remains above target due to tariff impacts, the Fed recognizes it needs to move policy closer to neutral without waiting for full confirmation in data. Though a 50bp cut remains possible given jobs deterioration, majority of members caution regarding tariff-induced inflation makes 25bp the most likely outcome, aligning with market expectations.

4. 【🚨Fed Decision Showdown: JPMorgan Maps Out Scenarios That Could Send Stocks Soaring — or Crashing 5%】JPMorgan has mapped out how stocks could swing depending on how the Fed moves this week. Here’s the breakdown:<br/><b>1. The “Dovish Cut” — Most Likely (47.5% chance)</b><br/>Fed slashes rates by 25 bps and issue dovish language.<br/>Immediate reaction: S&P 500 pops +1% to ~6,650.<br/>But beware: JPMorgan warns a <b>sell-the-news slide</b> could drag stocks down as much as <b>5%</b> in the weeks ahead.<br/>Buying opportunities if that happens:<br/><b>Mega-cap tech & AI names</b> — JPMorgan stays overweight.<br/><b>Utilities</b> — poised to benefit if rate expectations and 10Y yields fall.<br/><b>2. The “Hawkish Cut” — Second Likeliest (40% chance)</b><br/>Fed delivers the expected 25 bps cut but signals hawkish concerns.<br/>S&P 500 likely stalls or dips -0.5%.<br/>Powell could hint that the<b> job market is now a bigger worry than inflation</b>, undercutting the rally.<br/><b>3. The “Shock and Awe” Scenarios — Low Odds, High Volatility (11.5% chance)</b><br/><b>No cut (4%)</b>: Stocks sink 1%-2%, pushing the S&P 500 toward 6,450.<br/><b>Jumbo cut of 50 bps (7.5%)</b>: Market chaos — S&P 500 could<b> swing ±1.5%</b> depending on how investors read the move.

5. 【Fed's Pace on Cuts Key for Markets: Morgan Stanley】Morgan Stanley says equity markets hinge on weak U.S. jobs data and whether the Fed cuts rates quickly enough. Traders expect a 25 bp cut this week, but lingering inflation may slow the Fed’s response. The bank sees short-term consolidation in stocks but remains bullish long term, targeting the S&P 500 at 7,200 by mid-2026 on strong earnings. They favor small caps and reflation plays ahead, while dip-buying into year-end. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995653-a50e-755e-85d3-54b6d59e0196]
6. 【Risk of Longer-Dated Yields Rising Post Likely Fed Rate Cut Seen as Limited: Julius Baer】There are worries about a repeat of September 2024 when longer-maturity Treasurys yields rose after the Federal Reserve's larger-than-usual 50-basis point rate cut, says Julius Baer's Dario Messi in a note. However, the risks of that repeating are limited this time around, says the head of fixed income. Despite some valid arguments, the current starting point offers more cushion against such a development and risks are more limited at this point, Messi says. The 10-year Treasury yield is currently higher than it was in Sept. 2024 when the Fed started its rate cuts. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995645-e9ab-755e-85d3-3b79f4411e20]
7. 【Fed Rate Cuts Seen as Good News for U.S. Treasury Holders: Insight Investment】A rate-cutting environment is potentially good news for those invested in U.S. bonds through globally diversified fixed income portfolios, says Insight Investment's Harley Bradley in a note. The Federal Reserve is set to cut interest rates on Wednesday, even as tariffs could still lead to higher inflation, the co-head of global rates says. Given relatively stubborn inflation in the U.S., markets will be closely watching the Fed's latest 'dot plot' projections for future rate cuts beyond September, he says. "In our view, while inflation could complicate the outcome, we believe [the] central bank will be prepared to 'look through' higher than target inflation to protect the labor market."

8. 【US Stocks Steady as Fed Looms; Retail Sales Beat, Oracle and Tesla Gain】U.S. equities held to modest gains Tuesday morning as traders positioned for the Federal Reserve to resume its interest-rate cutting cycle. The S&P 500 was little changed at 9:45 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 struggled to maintain a small advance. A close higher would mark the benchmark’s 10th straight gain, its longest winning streak since November 2021.<br/>Among individual movers, Oracle rose after CBS News reported it is part of a consortium that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a potential framework deal. Tesla advanced even as U.S. auto safety regulators launched an investigation into possible defects with some vehicle doors.<br/>Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales climbed 0.6% in August, following a similar gain in July, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Excluding autos, sales increased 0.7%. Nine of 13 categories rose, underscoring resilient consumer spending and beating all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

9. 【Fed Could Continue Cutting Rates in 2026, 2027: Credit Mutuel Asset Management】The Federal Reserve is expected to begin a cycle of interest-rate cuts this week which could continue into 2027, Credit Mutuel Asset Management's Francois Rimeu says in a note. "Slowing activity and labor market weakness argue for greater monetary easing than anticipated in June, leading to a lower terminal rate by 2027," the senior strategist says. Beyond an anticipated 25-basis-point cut this week, Credit Mutuel expects another reduction this year, two further cuts in 2026 and another cut to 3.1% in 2027, close to the long-term rate of 3%, he says. For 2028, Credit Mutuel expects stable rates. U.S. money markets currently price in almost six rate cuts by the end of next year, data show.

10. 【Analysts Split on Cut Size Ahead of September FOMC Meeting】<b>Thierry Wizman (Macquarie)</b>: Fed will balance downside risks to employment without signaling a long string of cuts.<br/><b>Lon Erickson (Thornburg):</b> Unlikely to see another 50-bp cut this year; inflation remains the wild card.<br/><b>Samuel Tombs (Pantheon Macroeconomics)</b>: Predicts a possible three-way split among governors, with some voting for a 50-bp cut, a majority for a smaller cut, and a few for no change.<br/><b>Jim Caron (Morgan Stanley) and Michael Feroli (JPMorgan)</b>: Fed will likely choose a smaller, measured cut rather than aggressive action.<br/><b>Claudia Sahm (New Century Advisors)</b>: Cut expected due to weak employment rather than favorable inflation; still sees inflation as “too firm.”<br/><b>Brian Buetel (UBS Wealth Management)</b>: Forecasts a 100-bp cumulative cut over the next four meetings through January 2026.<br/><b>James Bullard (former St. Louis Fed)</b>: Supports a 25-bp cut and signals further easing, noting tariffs are likely a temporary inflation influence.

11. 【A Dovish Fed Guidance Could Boost Asian Equities: Eastspring Investments】A dovish guidance by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell at this week's meeting could catalyse further U.S. dollar weakness, boosting Asian equities, say Vis Nayar and Ray Farris at Eastspring Investments. "Asian equities market outperformance this year has come mainly from local funds, but a resumption of U.S. dollar weakness could spur foreign diversification flows out of the U.S. into emerging markets," they write in a note. Improving earnings fundamentals have also been a key driver of recently strong Asian equities, they say, with U.S. trade deals leading to higher year-ahead earnings estimates in most Asian markets. Asian markets' main risks would be if the median 2026 Fed Funds rate dot remains unchanged or if Powell downplays the outlook for cuts, they add.
