3. 【China Tests First Domestic Advanced Chipmaking Tool to Challenge ASML and US Export Controls】China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) is testing the country’s first domestically produced advanced deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machine, developed by Shanghai-based start-up Yuliangsheng, in an effort to reduce reliance on ASML’s equipment and overcome US export controls. The machine, which uses immersion technology similar to ASML’s, is capable of producing 7nm chips using multi-patterning techniques and potentially 5nm chips at lower yields, though it remains far behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), which will begin mass production of 2nm chips using ASML’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) equipment this year. While most components in Yuliangsheng’s machine are made domestically, some parts are still sourced internationally, with plans to fully localize production in the future. SMIC’s trials show promising early results, but mass production could take years, as stability and yield adjustments typically require at least a year. Meanwhile, Shenzhen-based SiCarrier, a shareholder of Yuliangsheng, has unveiled advanced chipmaking equipment and is dedicating resources to developing EUV machines under its “Mount Everest” project, though these efforts remain in early stages. Chinese chipmakers aim to triple output by 2026, primarily relying on earlier-stocked ASML DUV machines, while domestic tools are expected to start mass production around 2027.
