1. 【China Tech Stocks Surge to 2021 Level as Investors Bet on AI】Chinese technology stocks listed in Hong Kong jumped to their highest level in almost four years as optimism over artificial intelligence fueled demand. Saxo Markets chief investment strategist Charu Chanana said that China tech leaders are visibly re-accelerating AI spend and product rollouts — models, robotaxis, in-house chips — while also proving they can monetize AI faster than many expected. “With valuations lagging the U.S., investors are starting to pay attention again.”<br/>- <b>Hang Seng Tech Index</b> rose as much as 3.5%, hitting its highest level since November 2021.<br/>- <b>Alibaba </b>up nearly 6%. China Unicom’s Sanjiangyuan data center has signed contracts to deploy AI chips from Chinese firms including Alibaba’s chip unit T-Head. Alibaba raised $3.2 billion from a blockbuster convertible bond offering last week.<br/>- <b>CATL </b>H-shares surpass HK$500, up 5.8% intraday to record high since May IPO. JPMorgan analysts noted that CATL's Hong Kong-listed shares are on track for their highest close since May, driven by bullish outlooks from equipment makers and growing energy-storage investment in China.<br/>- <b>Tencent </b>up nearly 2% to HK$658, market cap back above HK$6 trillion. Tencent turned to the dim sum bond market for a 9 billion yuan ($1.27 billion) on Tuesday, its first bond sale in four years.<br/>- <b>Baidu </b>Inc. shares surged as much as 15% in Hong Kong, marking their biggest jump since March 2023.<br/>- <b>Meituan </b>up over as much as 6%.<br/>- <b>JD.com</b> up nearly 4%.

2. 【CATL H-shares Hit record high In Early Trading, Last up 6.18% in HK 】Chinese investors are increasingly optimistic about the commercialization of solid-state electric vehicle batteries, a next-generation technology replacing some liquid components with solids, fueling major gains in industry stocks. <b>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.’s Hong Kong-listed shares are on track for their highest close since May, driven by bullish outlooks from equipment makers and growing energy-storage investment in China, JPMorgan analysts noted.</b> <br/>In early trading, CATL H-shares surpass HK$500, up 5.8% intraday to record high since May IPO; A-shares up over 5%.<br/>Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipment Co. has reported a “complete” production process and expects rising orders for solid-state technology, while Gotion High-Tech Co. plans “semi-solid” mass production next year and EVE Energy Co. opened a solid-state research base in Chengdu. Max Reid of CRU Group said confidence in commercialization timelines has grown, with mass production now expected in the late 2020s.

6. 【China Tests First Domestic Advanced Chipmaking Tool to Challenge ASML and US Export Controls】China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) is testing the country’s first domestically produced advanced deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machine, developed by Shanghai-based start-up Yuliangsheng, in an effort to reduce reliance on ASML’s equipment and overcome US export controls. The machine, which uses immersion technology similar to ASML’s, is capable of producing 7nm chips using multi-patterning techniques and potentially 5nm chips at lower yields, though it remains far behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), which will begin mass production of 2nm chips using ASML’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) equipment this year. While most components in Yuliangsheng’s machine are made domestically, some parts are still sourced internationally, with plans to fully localize production in the future. SMIC’s trials show promising early results, but mass production could take years, as stability and yield adjustments typically require at least a year. Meanwhile, Shenzhen-based SiCarrier, a shareholder of Yuliangsheng, has unveiled advanced chipmaking equipment and is dedicating resources to developing EUV machines under its “Mount Everest” project, though these efforts remain in early stages. Chinese chipmakers aim to triple output by 2026, primarily relying on earlier-stocked ASML DUV machines, while domestic tools are expected to start mass production around 2027.
