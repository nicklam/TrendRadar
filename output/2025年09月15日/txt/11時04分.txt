4. 【US-China Talks in Madrid: Lastest Progress】<b>Officials from the United States and China met in Madrid on Sunday</b> for their fourth round of talks aiming to extend a truce in President Trump’s trade war.<br/><b>Lastest News</b><br/>· The talks lasted more than six hours on Sunday and are expected to <b>continue into Monday or Tuesday.</b> Mr. Bessent plans to join Mr. Trump for a state visit in London on Wednesday.<br/>· <b>Trump </b>told reporters later on Sunday that the talks are <b>“going fine,”</b> but said that TikTok’s fate will be determined by Beijing’s actions.<br/>· The talks are due to<b> resume between 8 and 10 a.m. local time (0600 to 0800 GMT) on Monday </b>with tentative post-talks press conferences scheduled by the parties in the afternoon.<br/><b>China</b><br/>· China's Ministry of Commerce has said the Madrid <b>talks will cover economic and trade issues such as U.S. tariffs</b>, the "abuse" of export controls and TikTok.<br/>· <b>On Saturday, China announced that it was opening an investigation into exports of certain microchips</b> that are made in the United States. The day before, the U.S. Commerce Department said it was adding Chinese chip companies to a trade blacklist. The moves are expected to put additional pressure on the talks.<br/><b>Experts Says</b><br/>· Trade experts said there was <b>little likelihood of a substantial breakthrough</b> in the talks hosted by Spain. The most likely result of the Madrid talks is seen as another extension of a deadline for the popular TikTok app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations by September 17 or face a U.S. shutdown.<br/>· "This meeting is <b>an opportunity to measure each other's positions</b> and to learn more about each side's red lines," Reinsch, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said.<br/>· Wendy Cutler, a former USTR trade negotiator and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, said she <b>too expected more substantial "deliverables" to be saved for a potential Trump Xi meeting later this year, perhaps at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul at the end of October</b>. These may include a final resolution on TikTok, and a lifting of restrictions on Chinese purchases of American soybeans and reduction of fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods, she added.
