2. 【Crypto Market Loses $300 Billion as Leveraged Bets Unwind】Cryptocurrencies shed roughly $300 billion this week as leveraged positions unraveled, with over $3 billion in long positions liquidated across perpetual futures, according to Coinglass. Ether fell about 12%, sliding below $4,000, while Bitcoin dropped around 5%, its sharpest weekly decline since March. US-listed Bitcoin and Ether ETFs saw over $500 million in net outflows on Thursday. Corporate treasury Bitcoin purchases plunged 76% from July to September, per CryptoQuant. Paul Howard, senior director at Wincent, called the retreat “a healthy correction,” noting macro pressures may keep prices under pressure. Arthur Azizov, B2 Ventures, said, “Bitcoin’s drop below $109,000 is a sign that the market is overheated and moving into a slowdown phase.” [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=0199872b-f1f9-711c-880f-bc6162da381b]

It runs on a new system called Linwood, built with large language models from Apple’s Foundation Models team and a third-party provider. Apple is also in talks with Google about integrating Gemini. CEO Tim Cook told staff Apple must win in AI, calling it the company’s biggest transformation in decades. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01998728-0a10-711c-880f-a6a0712bbe33]
4. 【Fed’s Bowman urges decisive rate cuts, smaller balance sheet】Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said decisive rate cuts are needed to offset labor market fragility, warning risks of being behind the curve. She backed the September 25-bp cut after previously dissenting in July for more easing, and dismissed tariff-driven inflation fears, noting underlying inflation remains near target. Bowman urged focus on supporting jobs over inflation concerns, called for the smallest possible balance sheet with reserves closer to scarce, favored an all-Treasury portfolio skewed to shorter maturities, and suggested selling MBS rather than relying on runoff.
