1. 【UBS’s Zhao Says Fed Hikes Next Year Will Widen Treasury Spreads】Kevin Zhao of UBS Asset Management said the Fed may deliver two more rate cuts by year-end, but rising growth, falling unemployment, and persistent inflation could force rate hikes next year. He expects the 2-year/10-year Treasury yield spread to widen to 100 basis points once markets anticipate hikes, steepening the curve. Zhao noted his fund waits for spreads near 40 bps to trade, and his Global Dynamic Bond Fund has returned over 7% YTD.

2. 【Tepper Warns Fed Easing Risks “Danger Territory” Despite More Cuts】Hedge fund manager David Tepper said the Fed could cut rates further, but excessive easing risks reigniting inflation, weakening the dollar, and fueling asset bubbles. Tepper noted that one to three rate cuts are manageable given current restrictive conditions, but beyond that, risks mount. He remains constructive on equities due to easing, despite high valuations, and disclosed he trades Nvidia positions selectively while maintaining exposure.

3. 【Bitcoin Faces 70% Chance of New Highs Within Two Weeks】Bitcoin is trading near $117,800 with analysts assigning a 70% probability it will reach fresh all-time highs in the next two weeks. Spot ETF inflows totaling $2.8 billion since Sept. 9 and bullish futures premiums support the outlook. Internal liquidity around $114,000 could trigger a short-term pullback, though recent price behavior shows BTC skipping retracements and advancing directly toward higher levels.<br/>Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. said, “There’s a 70% chance the next two weeks will see a stepwise uptrend or sideways consolidation,” citing balanced MVRV Z-Scores and seasonal strength. He added that futures structure remains bullish, though some overheating appeared ahead of the Fed’s meeting. Adler noted that if BTC closes above $117,500, it would confirm a new break of structure and sharply reduce the odds of a dip below $114,000. He concluded, “Uptober incoming,” signaling expectations of a strong month. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995da4-f5f7-7cc5-9c40-e5565ade4d93]
4. 【Dollar Rebounds After Fed Rate Cut Disappoints Markets】The U.S. dollar strengthened against major currencies following the Federal Reserve’s 25-basis-point rate cut, as Chair Jerome Powell signaled no urgency for further easing. Data showed U.S. jobless claims fell last week. The pound slipped 0.5% after the Bank of England held rates and slowed gilt sales. The Norwegian crown dropped 0.6% after a 25-bp rate cut, while the Japanese yen fell 0.7% ahead of the Bank of Japan’s policy decision. The New Zealand dollar weakened 1.3% after Q2 GDP contracted 0.9%. Bitcoin rose 1.8% to $117,748.<br/>Eric Theoret, FX strategist at Scotiabank, said Powell’s guidance “fell short of the ‘unequivocal dovishness that the markets were expecting.’” Theoret noted that recent upbeat U.S. data and heavy early-week dollar selling “was enough to lift the dollar.” Goldman Sachs analysts observed that prior hints suggested Wednesday’s cut could be “the first among many,” whereas ANZ analysts described Powell’s comments as “not at all dovish,” highlighting market divergence over Fed messaging.

5. 【Nick Timiraos on Powell Speech】Markets reacted to Powell framing the policy decision Wednesday as a "risk-management cut" (even though that's what this was; if it wasn't, then it means you're seeing much worse data or expecting it imminently, in which case, you're not writing down a shallow sequence of cuts to neutral).<br/>But a later exchange was probably more revealing. It showed how Powell is thinking about that risk-management exercise in a way that reinforces a strong presumption to cut another two times as part of this risk-management exercise. One way to read his answer: The Fed is providing support not just with the 25 bps cut, but by not pushing back on the 50 bps that's been priced (which will require following through if the risks to the labor market don't suddenly look a lot better).
