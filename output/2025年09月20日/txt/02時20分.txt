1. 【U.S. Treasury Yields Edge Up, Daly's Speech Awaited: Pepperstone】U.S. Treasury yields rise in Asian trade, adding to an increase of global yields on Thursday. The U.S. data calendar is thin, while Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco delivers a speech at AI Implications for Workforce Development and Economic Mobility event. "The Fed's 'blackout' period is now at an end, meaning we'll receive not only remarks from 2027 voter Daly this evening, but should also at some stage get a statement from Gov. Miran explaining his dissent [at Wednesday's rate decision]," says Pepperstone's Michael Brown in a note. The two-year Treasury yield rises 1 basis point to 3.576%; the 10-year Treasury yield rises 3.1 basis points to 4.134% and the 30-year Treasury yield rises 3.8 basis points to 4.757%, according to data.

3. 【Tug of War Between U.S. Growth and Inflation Continues: Federated Hermes】The jury is still out on this tug of war between U.S. growth and inflation, says Federated Hermes' John Sidawi in a note. The impact of global tariffs has yet to be fully realised and the question of whether fiscal impulses will be sufficient to offset the drag of import taxes remains a large unknown, the senior portfolio manager for international fixed income says. "Much to the dismay of the FX and interest rate market the direction of US monetary policy remains very clear," but it was the journey that both markets mispriced Wednesday, he says.

4. 【Ray Dalio Warns US Debt Crisis Threatens Global Monetary Order】Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, warned during the FutureChina Global Forum in Singapore that the accumulation of US government debt is threatening the global monetary order and potentially signaling the decline of the US empire. He highlighted that the US is overspending by 30% and needs to sell $12 trillion in debt, creating a supply-demand imbalance due to insufficient global demand for such debt. Dalio attributed this runaway credit to "human nature." Ng Kok Song, founding partner of Avanda Investment Management, added that similar debt issues are affecting the UK, France, and China, but emphasized that the US has reached a critical tipping point, though the timing of a potential crisis remains uncertain.

5. 【Trump’s Team Explores Government-Backed Manufacturing Boost: MAGA Steps】<b>President Trump’s team is considering a plan to boost U.S. manufacturing by using a $550 billion investment fund from trade negotiations with Japan to develop semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, energy, ships, and quantum computing, with some projects receiving preferential treatment such as expedited regulatory review</b>, according to documents and people familiar with the discussions. The administration is exploring granting leases to companies for access to federal land and water, marking a new level of government involvement in reshaping manufacturing. Details are still being finalized, and plans could change, sources said. White House spokesman Kush Desai said the fund “will be key to fueling America’s next Golden Age.” Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have discussed building gas turbine and generic pharmaceutical facilities, new nuclear plants, and pipelines, including a joint LNG pipeline venture in Alaska with Japan, according to sources.
