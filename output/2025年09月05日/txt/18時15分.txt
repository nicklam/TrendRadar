6. 【South Korea Introduces First Virtual Asset Lending Guidelines, Bans Leverage and Sets User Limits】South Korean financial authorities have introduced the first guidelines for virtual asset lending services amid growing investor protection concerns due to intensified competition among exchanges. The Financial Services Commission (FSC), along with the Financial Supervisory Service and the Digital Asset Exchange Alliance (DAXA), implemented self-regulatory "Virtual Asset Lending Guidelines" on September 5th. The new framework prohibits leverage lending exceeding collateral value and cash lending with Korean won repayment, while restricting exchanges to using only their own assets without third-party delegation. User protection measures include mandatory online education and qualification tests for first-time users, differentiated lending limits of 30-70 million won based on trading experience, pre-notification requirements for forced liquidation risks, and annual interest rate caps of 20%. Market stability provisions limit eligible assets to top 20 market cap cryptocurrencies or those listed on three or more Korean won exchanges, excluding trading caution or suspicious trading assets. Exchanges must also establish internal controls to prevent excessive price volatility from concentration in specific assets and mandatorily disclose lending status and forced liquidation cases by asset type. A FSC official stated that without proper regulation, the spread of high-risk lending services could inevitably harm investors, and they plan to establish order through self-regulation before pursuing swift legislation based on operational results.
