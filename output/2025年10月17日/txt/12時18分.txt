1. 【Deutsche Bank Sees Fed Ending QT by December】Deutsche Bank strategists, including Matthew Raskin and Steven Zeng, now expect the Federal Reserve to announce the end of quantitative tightening at the December FOMC meeting, with the runoff completing in January 2026. Officials are likely to discuss QT timelines and operational details, while future “reserve management purchases” could begin in January 2027. The bank notes that a cautious runoff approach may reduce repo market stress and support relative-value strategies, including wider swap spreads.

2. 【Waller Signals October Cut as Miran Pushes Bold Easing】Federal Reserve Governor Christopher <b>Waller signaled support for a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed’s October 28–29 meeting</b>, citing <b>weakening labor market conditions </b>despite solid GDP growth. Waller highlighted <b>“clear warning signs” in job demand</b>, noting lower net immigration and declining labor force participation. He suggested<b> further cuts could bring the policy rate toward a neutral 2.75%–3.00% range</b> if hiring remains soft and inflation stays contained.<br/>Meanwhile, Fed Governor Stephen <b>Miran advocated a more aggressive easing path</b>, citing <b>new risks</b> from <b>U.S.-China trade tensions</b> and<b> restrictive monetary policy</b>, while downplaying concerns over potential financial market imbalances. Analysts at <b>Evercore ISI </b>noted <b>Waller’s remarks “mark a notable shift” from prior dovishness</b>, emphasizing the balance between growth and labor data. <b>The Fed’s September forecasts suggest rates may fall to 3.25%–3.50% next year,</b> with policymakers monitoring employment and inflation closely amid the partial government shutdown.

3. 【Apple Plans Touch-Screen MacBook Pro With Hole-Punch Display, OLED, M6 Chips】Apple Inc. is developing a high-end MacBook Pro with a touch display, OLED screen, thinner frame, and M6 chips, targeting late 2026 or early 2027. The laptops will retain a full keyboard and trackpad, adopt a hole-punch design instead of the notch, and include reinforced hinges to prevent screen movement. Sources said Apple’s devices, code-named K114 and K116, mark a shift from its long-standing policy against vertical touch surfaces. Apple is testing market reception before expanding touch screens to other Macs. Other Macs in development include M5-updated MacBook Airs (J813, J815), Mac Studio, Mac mini, and external monitors (J427, J527).

4. 【Citi, Morgan Stanley See Core Goods Driving September CPI, Shaping Fed Decisions】The U.S. government <b>shutdown </b>has <b>delayed </b>key economic data, including <b>September employment and some inflation releases</b>, complicating the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions ahead of its next meeting. Officials are relying on <b>private-sector sources and business anecdotes</b> to gauge labor-market and consumer trends, <b>making another quarter-point rate cut likely.</b><br/><b>Cleveland Fed nowcasting projects September headline CPI +0.4% M/M (3.0% Y/Y) and core CPI +0.3% M/M (3.0% Y/Y).</b> <b>Citi </b>Economist Veronica Clark expects “modestly stronger goods inflation but still slowing services,” with <b>core PCE inflation forecast at +0.26% for September. </b><b>Morgan Stanley </b>economists led by Diego Anzoategui <b>see core CPI +0.32% M/M (3.12% Y/Y)</b>, noting that “apparel, used and new cars decelerate, but we see payback in other goods, reaccelerating after the downside surprise in August,” while tracking ISM and PMI data for tariff pass-through.<br/><b>Deutsche Bank</b>’s Matthew Luzzetti notes that <b>missing data limits support for aggressive Fed action,</b> and Fed Governor Chris Waller observes private indicators suggest the labor market remains weak.
