4. 【China’s Rate-Cut Outlook in Doubt as Stock Rally Stirs Concern】Concerns within China’s leadership that easy money is fueling a massive stock rally are raising the risk of delaying another major round of monetary stimulus, potentially keeping the People’s Bank of China on the sidelines as Beijing works to sustain growth. Regulators are weighing steps to avoid a repeat of the 2015 crash that erased $6.8 trillion in market value, and the PBOC may move next to address those fears. While many economists still expect a small interest-rate cut before year-end, Citigroup and Nomura warned the central bank may hold off on actions such as lowering borrowing costs or reducing reserve requirements that would add liquidity to the market.
