7. 【US Proposes Annual Approval System for Samsung and SK Hynix Exports to Chinese Factories】The US has proposed annual approvals for exports of chipmaking supplies to Samsung and SK Hynix’s factories in China, replacing the Biden-era perpetual waivers under the Validated End User (VEU) program, which are set to expire by year-end. The new "site license" system requires South Korea’s largest chipmakers to seek approval for exact quantities of restricted gear, parts, and materials annually, adding complexity but allowing continued operations at their major Chinese facilities. This move follows Washington's broader semiconductor export controls aimed at curbing China’s technological advancements, while balancing national security concerns with minimizing disruptions to the global electronics supply chain. South Korean officials are relieved that a path forward exists but frustrated by the increased administrative burden. Industry concerns include potential delays in approvals for urgent shipments not specified in the license, though US officials insist on robust systems to address such issues. The proposal reflects Washington’s desire for greater oversight and control over supplies to prevent technology leakage or equipment misuse, while South Korean officials argue that existing VEU security measures already address these concerns. Discussions remain ongoing, and no final decision has been made. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019927f9-83e8-799d-bda2-68b5e91fb4f2]
