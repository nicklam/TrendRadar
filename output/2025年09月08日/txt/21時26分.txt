7. 【US Proposes Annual Approval System for Samsung and SK Hynix Exports to Chinese Factories】The US has proposed annual approvals for exports of chipmaking supplies to Samsung and SK Hynix’s factories in China, replacing the Biden-era perpetual waivers under the Validated End User (VEU) program, which are set to expire by year-end. The new "site license" system requires South Korea’s largest chipmakers to seek approval for exact quantities of restricted gear, parts, and materials annually, adding complexity but allowing continued operations at their major Chinese facilities. This move follows Washington's broader semiconductor export controls aimed at curbing China’s technological advancements, while balancing national security concerns with minimizing disruptions to the global electronics supply chain. South Korean officials are relieved that a path forward exists but frustrated by the increased administrative burden. Industry concerns include potential delays in approvals for urgent shipments not specified in the license, though US officials insist on robust systems to address such issues. The proposal reflects Washington’s desire for greater oversight and control over supplies to prevent technology leakage or equipment misuse, while South Korean officials argue that existing VEU security measures already address these concerns. Discussions remain ongoing, and no final decision has been made. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019927f9-83e8-799d-bda2-68b5e91fb4f2]

14. 【China’s Rate-Cut Outlook in Doubt as Stock Rally Stirs Concern】Concerns within China’s leadership that easy money is fueling a massive stock rally are raising the risk of delaying another major round of monetary stimulus, potentially keeping the People’s Bank of China on the sidelines as Beijing works to sustain growth. Regulators are weighing steps to avoid a repeat of the 2015 crash that erased $6.8 trillion in market value, and the PBOC may move next to address those fears. While many economists still expect a small interest-rate cut before year-end, Citigroup and Nomura warned the central bank may hold off on actions such as lowering borrowing costs or reducing reserve requirements that would add liquidity to the market.
