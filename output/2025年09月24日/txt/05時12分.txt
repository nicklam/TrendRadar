3. 【Takeaway from Powell’s Remarks at the Rhode Island Event】- <b>Fed Policy Stance</b>: Interest rates remain “<b>still modestly restrictive</b>” after the recent quarter-point cut; Fed is well-positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions.<br/>- <b>Two-Sided Risks</b>: Easing too quickly could reignite inflation; staying too restrictive could weigh on labor markets. <b>No risk-free path exists</b>.<br/>- <b>Labor Market</b>: Conditions have softened; hiring is low, particularly for new entrants, and downside risks to employment persist.<br/>- <b>Inflation Outlook</b>: Inflation remains somewhat elevated; tariff-driven price pressures are largely one-time and not a main factor. Long-run expectations remain near 2%.<br/>- <b>Economic Growth</b>: Growth has moderated; effects of major policy shifts are still unfolding; uncertainty is affecting business investment and hiring.<br/>- <b>AI and Labor</b>: AI may phase out some jobs but also create new roles; not the main driver of low hiring rates.<br/>- <b>Policy Approach</b>: Fed is using a “risk-management” approach, considering a range of plausible outcomes rather than a preset course.<br/>- <b>Political Independence</b>: Powell emphasized the Fed does <b>not take politics into account</b>; claims of political bias are “cheap shots.”<br/>- <b>Market Impact</b>: Treasury yields fell slightly; U.S. stock indexes were mostly unchanged; U.S. dollar edged up marginally.

4. 【Nick Timiraos: Powell Says Rates Are "Still Modestly Restrictive"】Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the central bank’s interest-rate stance as “still modestly restrictive” following last week’s quarter-point cut, <b>suggesting potential for additional reductions if labor-market softness persists</b>. Powell emphasized two-sided risks, warning that overly rapid cuts could push inflation above the 2% target, while maintaining restrictive policy too long could soften labor markets. He highlighted one-time tariff-driven price rises and reaffirmed that recent job growth slowdown justified the Fed’s measured approach. Projections indicate some officials foresee at least two more cuts this year. Powell did not address political controversies involving Trump and the attempted removal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook.

6. 【Gold prices surged to a record high as traders awaited Fed Chair Powell’s speech】Gold prices surged to a record high, with <b>COMEX gold futures breaking over $3,800/oz and spot gold reaching $3,790.21/oz, up 1.16% on the day</b>, as traders awaited <b>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech</b> for further policy cues amid expectations of <b>additional rate cuts.</b> Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued rates remain too high and called for steeper cuts to protect the labor market. <b>Gold is up 43.5% this year, supported by safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, a softer dollar, and central banks diversifying away from the U.S. dollar.</b> Traders now await Friday’s U.S. personal consumption expenditures data for further policy signals. Meanwhile, <b>China aims to become a global custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves via the Shanghai Gold Exchange, encouraging friendly central banks to purchase and store gold domestically, bolstering its international bullion role and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.</b> <b>The PBOC has been buying gold for ten consecutive months, </b>eased import restrictions, and launched offshore yuan-denominated contracts in Hong Kong, supporting record-high prices and attracting nations seeking reserve security.

8. 【Fed Can't Hand out Cuts Like Candy at a Party: Swissquote】The U.S. two-year yield has rebounded past 3.60% even after Trump-linked economist Stephen Miran argued that the neutral rate is much lower than current levels and that he would cut rates by 150 basis points very quickly to get there. It's the kind of comments that are so far-stretched they can't be taken seriously enough to shift market expectations, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. Proof? The two-year yields have moved higher, she adds. That's a sign that lowering rates wouldn't necessarily bring down long-term borrowing costs if the size and the speed of easing aren't warranted, she says. The reality is that the Fed can't hand out rate cuts like candy at a party, she says. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019975e3-24e4-7cc5-9c6b-2c15c2138506]

10. 【Gold Hits Record High on U.S. Rate-Cut Hopes】Gold prices continue to push higher, setting a record high on Tuesday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further this year. In early trade, futures rise 0.4% to $3,788.80 a troy ounce, after touching $3,795.10 earlier in the session as traders await Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech for further policy cues. Meanwhile, Fed Gov. Stephen Miran made the case that interest rates are too high. Miran said steeper cuts are needed to avoid unnecessary damage to the labor market. <b>The precious metal is up 43.5% this year, driven by strong safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, a softer dollar, and continued diversification by central banks away from dollar holdings. Traders now await Friday's U.S. personal consumption expenditures data, which could boost the case for additional monetary stimulus.</b> [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019975a0-eb15-7cc5-9c6a-62ab675798d3]

12. 【Gold Steady, Supported by Hopes for More Fed Rate Cuts: FFA Kings】Gold is steady in the early Asian trade, supported by hopes for more Fed rate cuts. Fed Chair Powell is scheduled to deliver comments on the U.S. economy later today. The precious metal hit another record high overnight, building on momentum from last week's Fed rate cut and guidance that further easing is likely as the labor market weakens, FFA Kings' Fadi Al Kurdi says in an email. "Expectations of continued monetary loosening have reinforced demand for the non-yielding asset," the founder and CEO adds. Spot gold is little changed at $3,747.22/oz.
