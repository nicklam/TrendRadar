3. 【Takeaway from Powell’s Remarks at the Rhode Island Event】- <b>Fed Policy Stance</b>: Interest rates remain “<b>still modestly restrictive</b>” after the recent quarter-point cut; Fed is well-positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions.<br/>- <b>Two-Sided Risks</b>: Easing too quickly could reignite inflation; staying too restrictive could weigh on labor markets. <b>No risk-free path exists</b>.<br/>- <b>Labor Market</b>: Conditions have softened; hiring is low, particularly for new entrants, and downside risks to employment persist.<br/>- <b>Inflation Outlook</b>: Inflation remains somewhat elevated; tariff-driven price pressures are largely one-time and not a main factor. Long-run expectations remain near 2%.<br/>- <b>Economic Growth</b>: Growth has moderated; effects of major policy shifts are still unfolding; uncertainty is affecting business investment and hiring.<br/>- <b>AI and Labor</b>: AI may phase out some jobs but also create new roles; not the main driver of low hiring rates.<br/>- <b>Policy Approach</b>: Fed is using a “risk-management” approach, considering a range of plausible outcomes rather than a preset course.<br/>- <b>Political Independence</b>: Powell emphasized the Fed does <b>not take politics into account</b>; claims of political bias are “cheap shots.”<br/>- <b>Market Impact</b>: Treasury yields fell slightly; U.S. stock indexes were mostly unchanged; U.S. dollar edged up marginally.

4. 【Nick Timiraos: Powell Says Rates Are "Still Modestly Restrictive"】Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the central bank’s interest-rate stance as “still modestly restrictive” following last week’s quarter-point cut, <b>suggesting potential for additional reductions if labor-market softness persists</b>. Powell emphasized two-sided risks, warning that overly rapid cuts could push inflation above the 2% target, while maintaining restrictive policy too long could soften labor markets. He highlighted one-time tariff-driven price rises and reaffirmed that recent job growth slowdown justified the Fed’s measured approach. Projections indicate some officials foresee at least two more cuts this year. Powell did not address political controversies involving Trump and the attempted removal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook.

6. 【Gold prices surged to a record high as traders awaited Fed Chair Powell’s speech】Gold prices surged to a record high, with <b>COMEX gold futures breaking over $3,800/oz and spot gold reaching $3,790.21/oz, up 1.16% on the day</b>, as traders awaited <b>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech</b> for further policy cues amid expectations of <b>additional rate cuts.</b> Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued rates remain too high and called for steeper cuts to protect the labor market. <b>Gold is up 43.5% this year, supported by safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, a softer dollar, and central banks diversifying away from the U.S. dollar.</b> Traders now await Friday’s U.S. personal consumption expenditures data for further policy signals. Meanwhile, <b>China aims to become a global custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves via the Shanghai Gold Exchange, encouraging friendly central banks to purchase and store gold domestically, bolstering its international bullion role and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.</b> <b>The PBOC has been buying gold for ten consecutive months, </b>eased import restrictions, and launched offshore yuan-denominated contracts in Hong Kong, supporting record-high prices and attracting nations seeking reserve security.
