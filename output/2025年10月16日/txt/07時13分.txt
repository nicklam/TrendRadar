SOFR options for December show rising open interest, reflecting hedges for October or December moves. US two-year Treasury yields hit yearly lows near 3.5%. Vanguard’s John Madziyire said, “You do want to have that bias to be slightly long.” Delayed US economic data from the government shutdown and renewed US-China trade tensions are driving positioning, while JPMorgan surveys show neutral investor positions at a one-month high.
