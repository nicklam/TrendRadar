1. 【Gold prices surged to a record high as traders awaited Fed Chair Powell’s speech】Gold prices surged to a record high, with <b>COMEX gold futures breaking over $3,800/oz and spot gold reaching $3,790.21/oz, up 1.16% on the day</b>, as traders awaited <b>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech</b> for further policy cues amid expectations of <b>additional rate cuts.</b> Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued rates remain too high and called for steeper cuts to protect the labor market. <b>Gold is up 43.5% this year, supported by safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, a softer dollar, and central banks diversifying away from the U.S. dollar.</b> Traders now await Friday’s U.S. personal consumption expenditures data for further policy signals. Meanwhile, <b>China aims to become a global custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves via the Shanghai Gold Exchange, encouraging friendly central banks to purchase and store gold domestically, bolstering its international bullion role and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.</b> <b>The PBOC has been buying gold for ten consecutive months, </b>eased import restrictions, and launched offshore yuan-denominated contracts in Hong Kong, supporting record-high prices and attracting nations seeking reserve security.

3. 【Fed Can't Hand out Cuts Like Candy at a Party: Swissquote】The U.S. two-year yield has rebounded past 3.60% even after Trump-linked economist Stephen Miran argued that the neutral rate is much lower than current levels and that he would cut rates by 150 basis points very quickly to get there. It's the kind of comments that are so far-stretched they can't be taken seriously enough to shift market expectations, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. Proof? The two-year yields have moved higher, she adds. That's a sign that lowering rates wouldn't necessarily bring down long-term borrowing costs if the size and the speed of easing aren't warranted, she says. The reality is that the Fed can't hand out rate cuts like candy at a party, she says. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019975e3-24e4-7cc5-9c6b-2c15c2138506]

7. 【Expect Gradual Fed Rate Cuts Over Next Six Months: Julius Baer】The Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates gradually over the next six months, according to Julius Baer's David Kohl. Amid political pressure, the FOMC resumed exiting its restrictive monetary policy despite elevated inflation, the economist says in a note. However, there is limited risk of stoking inflation further due to weak domestic demand and slower income growth, Kohl writes. <b>"We are becoming increasingly confident that rates will continue to be cut gradually at each of the forthcoming meetings until March 2026." The policy stance will then shift to being broadly neutral, with a Fed funds target rate of 3.00%-3.25%, he says.</b> [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019975c0-2edf-7cc5-9c6a-b77d46ef745e]

10. 【China Seeks to Store Foreign Sovereign Gold to Boost Global Market Role】China is seeking to become a global custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves to bolster its position in the international bullion market, according to sources familiar with the matter. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), through the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), has been encouraging central banks from friendly nations to purchase and store gold within China’s borders. This initiative aligns with Beijing’s broader goal of reducing dependence on the US dollar and Western financial hubs such as London and Switzerland. The reserves would be housed in SGE-linked custodian warehouses and consist of newly acquired gold that contributes to foreign countries' reserves, rather than relocating existing stockpiles. While China’s domestic gold market is the largest globally, its reported central bank reserves rank fifth worldwide, far behind the UK’s 5,000 tons stored in the Bank of England’s vaults. However, the PBOC has been on a gold-buying spree for ten consecutive months, and demand from central banks has helped push gold prices to record highs. China has also eased restrictions on gold imports and launched offshore vaults and yuan-denominated gold contracts in Hong Kong to internationalize its currency and increase trading volumes. This move could attract nations looking to secure reserves and mitigate risks of financial isolation, particularly after the US and allies froze Russia’s foreign exchange reserves in 2022.

11. 【Gold Hits Record High on U.S. Rate-Cut Hopes】Gold prices continue to push higher, setting a record high on Tuesday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further this year. In early trade, futures rise 0.4% to $3,788.80 a troy ounce, after touching $3,795.10 earlier in the session as traders await Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech for further policy cues. Meanwhile, Fed Gov. Stephen Miran made the case that interest rates are too high. Miran said steeper cuts are needed to avoid unnecessary damage to the labor market. <b>The precious metal is up 43.5% this year, driven by strong safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, a softer dollar, and continued diversification by central banks away from dollar holdings. Traders now await Friday's U.S. personal consumption expenditures data, which could boost the case for additional monetary stimulus.</b> [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019975a0-eb15-7cc5-9c6a-62ab675798d3]
12. 【Gold Holds Near Record High Ahead of Powell’s Speech】Gold prices steadied on Tuesday after hitting a record high, supported by expectations of further U.S. rate cuts and a weaker dollar, while investors awaited comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for policy signals.<br/>Spot gold rose 0.2% to $3,753.25 per ounce at 0604 GMT, after reaching an all-time high of $3,759.02 earlier in the session.<br/>“This is predominantly driven by monetary policy expectations, potentially lower interest rates, and upside risks to inflation,” said Capital.com analyst Kyle Rodda.<br/>“The short-term trend remains bullish, but we expect a near-term pullback due to technical factors,” added OANDA senior market analyst Kelvin Wong.<br/>Powell’s speech at 1635 GMT is in focus, with investors also watching Friday’s release of the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

13. 【Gold Hits Record High of $3,749.27 in Asia, Driven by ETF Inflows Amid Fed Rate-Cut Cycle】Gold edged up to a record high of $3,749.27/oz in Asia on Tuesday. “After pulling back the day after the Fed’s 25 basis-point rate cut — potentially on some perceived caution in Powell’s FOMC comments — new upward momentum has taken root with ETF inflows still the driving force,” BMO Capital Markets analysts including Helen Amos and George Heppel said in a note late Monday. “With a rate-cutting cycle firmly on the table we think risk-reward remains positive for prices into” the fourth quarter.

15. 【Gold Steady, Supported by Hopes for More Fed Rate Cuts: FFA Kings】Gold is steady in the early Asian trade, supported by hopes for more Fed rate cuts. Fed Chair Powell is scheduled to deliver comments on the U.S. economy later today. The precious metal hit another record high overnight, building on momentum from last week's Fed rate cut and guidance that further easing is likely as the labor market weakens, FFA Kings' Fadi Al Kurdi says in an email. "Expectations of continued monetary loosening have reinforced demand for the non-yielding asset," the founder and CEO adds. Spot gold is little changed at $3,747.22/oz.

16. 【Gold Hits Record $3,749 as Fed Cut Bets Weigh on Dollar】Gold surged to a fresh all-time high of $3,749, up 1.6%, as traders price in Fed rate cuts and the US Dollar falls. Safe-haven flows were supported by ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and rising central bank demand, with Societe Generale noting 2025 purchases rebounding to 63 tonnes.<br/>US Treasury yields climbed slightly, but real yields remained supportive of bullion. Atlanta Fed’s Bostic expressed caution on cuts, while Richmond’s Barkin, St. Louis’ Musalem, Cleveland’s Hammack, and Fed Governor Miran signaled openness to easing if labor market or inflation trends shift. Fed rate cut odds for October 19 stand at 89%.<br/>Swiss gold exports to the US plunged 99% in August due to tariffs, but China’s imports jumped to 35 tonnes, the highest since May 2024.<br/>Technically, gold eyes $3,750 next, with potential targets at $3,800–$4,000. Support lies at $3,700, $3,650, and $3,600. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019972ea-0fa8-7cc5-9c65-0f0fdcf72793]
