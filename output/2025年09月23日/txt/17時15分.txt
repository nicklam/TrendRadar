2. 【Expect Gradual Fed Rate Cuts Over Next Six Months: Julius Baer】The Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates gradually over the next six months, according to Julius Baer's David Kohl. Amid political pressure, the FOMC resumed exiting its restrictive monetary policy despite elevated inflation, the economist says in a note. However, there is limited risk of stoking inflation further due to weak domestic demand and slower income growth, Kohl writes. <b>"We are becoming increasingly confident that rates will continue to be cut gradually at each of the forthcoming meetings until March 2026." The policy stance will then shift to being broadly neutral, with a Fed funds target rate of 3.00%-3.25%, he says.</b> [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019975c0-2edf-7cc5-9c6a-b77d46ef745e]

5. 【Huawei Unveils Three-Year Vision to Challenge Nvidia's AI Dominance with Innovative Clustering and Networking Technologies】Huawei Technologies Co. has openly acknowledged that its AI chips lack the raw power and speed of Nvidia Corp.'s offerings, but it aims to compete through brute force, networking expertise, and policy support. During its annual Huawei Connect conference, Rotating Chairman Eric Xu unveiled a three-year roadmap to challenge Nvidia’s dominance, introducing next-generation AI chips and upgraded “SuperPod” designs, which link up to 15,488 Ascend AI chips using a self-developed UnifiedBus interconnect protocol. Huawei claims this technology enables data transfer speeds up to 62 times faster than Nvidia's upcoming NVLink144. Despite US restrictions cutting Huawei off from advanced chipmaking processes and key suppliers like TSMC, the company is leveraging innovative clustering techniques to bridge performance gaps. The announcement coincided with broader advancements in AI chips from Chinese firms like Alibaba and Baidu, reflecting Beijing's push to prioritize chip development amid US-China tensions. Analysts note Huawei's progress in building a resilient local semiconductor ecosystem, although its chips still lag behind Nvidia’s in performance, with the Ascend 950 offering only 6% of Nvidia’s VR200 superchip capabilities. Huawei plans to overcome these limitations by scaling chip connectivity and memory access speeds, with the Ascend 970 projected to achieve 4 terabit-per-second interconnect speeds by 2028. While challenges remain, including poor yields and restricted access to advanced equipment, Huawei remains confident in its strategy to advance China’s AI industry through clustering and networking technologies.
