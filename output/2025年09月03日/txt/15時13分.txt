1. 【Crypto Expected to Handle a Tenth of Post-Trade Market by 2030: Citi Survey】A survey by Citi predicts that within five years, 10% of the global post-trade market turnover will be handled through stablecoins and tokenized securities, with bank-issued stablecoins expected to drive collateral efficiency, fund tokenization, and private market securities. The report, based on responses from 537 industry participants worldwide, highlights that over half of firms are piloting generative AI for post-trade processes, which ensure securities trades are verified, executed, and finalized. Citi notes that digital asset adoption has evolved from experimentation to strategic implementation since 2021, with liquidity and post-trade cost efficiencies identified as key drivers for investments in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). The report suggests DLT could significantly impact funding costs, financial resource requirements, and operating costs globally by 2028, signaling a transformative period for the post-trade industry.

2. 【Crypto.com CEO Bets on Fed Rate Cut to Fuel Crypto Markets in Q4: Cointelegraph】Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek is confident that digital assets will be boosted in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily driven by the US central bank reducing interest rates. Marszalek said in an interview on Tuesday that he’s betting on the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its Sept. 17 meeting, which is usually good for crypto as borrowing becomes cheaper and more liquidity is available for riskier investments.

3. 【Japan Considers Merging Crypto Oversight Into Securities Law, Faces Pushback】Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) presented a proposal during a Financial System Council working group on September 2 to regulate cryptocurrencies under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). Currently, crypto assets are governed by the Payment Services Act, but the agency believes shifting oversight to the FIEA would better address their rising role as investment products. Under the new framework, cryptocurrencies would be classified alongside securities, subjecting issuers and exchanges to stricter requirements. The FSA argued that tighter rules would deter market misconduct while ensuring transparency for investors. The FSA will submit a legislative amendment to the ordinary Diet session next year.
