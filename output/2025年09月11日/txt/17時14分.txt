4. 【China Mulls Helping Local Governments With $1 Trillion of Bills】China is planning to address a massive backlog of unpaid bills owed by local governments to private sector companies, with arrears estimated at over $1 trillion. The government is considering directing state lenders and policy banks, such as China Development Bank, to provide loans to local authorities to settle at least 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in overdue payments in the first phase of a longer-term initiative, aiming for completion by 2027. President Xi Jinping has highlighted the issue’s urgency, warning that delayed payments threaten business viability and public trust. Local government-related entities are estimated to owe around 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion), or 7% of China’s GDP, to corporates and civil servants. Authorities have instructed major banks to offer short-term liquidity loans to help regional governments repay affiliated entities’ debts, though banks are concerned about rising risks and require regulatory assurances. Chinese banks, already facing record-low margins and increasing bad loans, set aside 3.51 trillion yuan in allowances for loan losses in the first half of this year, up nearly 6% from year-end 2023.

10. 【China’s Zinc Producers Push for Higher Treatment Charges as Global Smelter Closures】China’s zinc producers are seeking better supply terms from overseas miners, supported by improved spot treatment charges for zinc concentrate delivered to China, which have risen to their highest in over 18 months due to global smelter closures in countries like Japan and Australia. The negotiating group for overseas supplies, according to Beijing Antaike Information Technology Co., is targeting treatment fees of $120 to $140 per ton in the fourth quarter, with spot fees surpassing $80 per ton at the end of last month. Jinrui Futures Co. Ltd noted that global mine output has been steady and is growing rapidly, resulting in looser supply conditions, with Russian zinc concentrate shipments to China more than doubling in the first seven months of the year. China’s refined zinc output hit a record high, and July imports of zinc concentrate reached their highest ever, with Russia supplying 12%, Australia 24%, and Peru 18%. In contrast, the annual benchmark for zinc treatment charges outside China fell to a record low of $80 per ton (inflation-adjusted), and LME stockpiles dropped to their lowest in over two years, highlighting tight global supply. The divergence between Chinese and global zinc markets is becoming more pronounced, as zinc prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange have remained steady since April, while international prices on the London Metal Exchange have started to recover. LME zinc stockpiles dropping to their lowest levels in over two years. Zeng Tong, an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co. Ltd, noted that with demand staying relatively stable, there has been a strong focus on clearing inventories in overseas markets throughout this year.
