2. 【Analysts Bullish on Apple as iPhone 17 Drives Sales Momentum】<b>Jim Cramer of CNBC </b>said Apple bulls are vindicated as naysayers on the iPhone upgrade cycle are proved wrong. He called misperceptions around tariffs and Siri “nonsense” and emphasized that the iPhone 17 is a buy. Cramer highlighted trade-in values and carrier discounts as factors making the new iPhones a bargain and stated that Apple shares have more room to run, advising investors to hold rather than trade the stock.<br/><b>Counterpoint Research</b> reported that iPhone 17 sales in the U.S. and China exceeded iPhone 16 models by 14% within the first 10 days of availability. The firm called the base model iPhone 17 compelling, citing improvements in chip performance, display, storage, and the selfie camera at the same price as the iPhone 16. Counterpoint also noted that the new iPhone Air, which is eSIM only, sold out quickly in China and performed slightly better than the iPhone 16 Plus.<br/><b>Loop Capital analysts </b>upgraded Apple to a buy from hold and raised the price target from $226 to $315, implying over 19% upside from session highs. They forecasted material upside to Street expectations through calendar year 2027, factoring in the performance of the iPhone 17 lineup.<br/><b>Ben Reitzes of Melius Research</b> said Apple is “on a mission to silence its critics” and could deliver a beat-and-raise quarter. He highlighted potential sales momentum in China, margin upside from the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and reduced tariff impact. Reitzes expects Apple shares to gain into calendar year 2026 and ahead of upcoming Siri/product events in March 2026, noting that Siri updates with significant AI enhancements are forthcoming.
