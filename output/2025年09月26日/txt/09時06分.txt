2. 【OpenAI Faces Trillion-Dollar Financing Challenge for AI Data Center Expansion】OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlined plans to expand its Stargate AI infrastructure, aiming to develop multiple data centers totaling 7 gigawatts of power at an estimated cost of $400 billion. The company plans to spend $50 billion per gigawatt, with $35 billion allocated to AI chips. Nvidia agreed to invest up to $100 billion, providing $10 billion upfront plus $10 billion per gigawatt deployed. OpenAI intends to lease chips, and Oracle will supply hardware for 4.5 additional gigawatts. Altman said, “<b>We still haven’t figured out the final form of what financing for compute looks like</b>.” Analysts raised caution: Heath Terry of Citi noted, “<b>AI is 100% moving at this pace and scale already, but it must continue to generate expected returns</b>,” while Jay Goldberg of Seaport Global Securities warned the Nvidia deal carries risks of “<b>circular financing</b>” reminiscent of dot-com era behaviors.

3. 【Fed’s Cook Urges Supreme Court to Block Trump’s Attempted Removal】Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reject President Trump’s effort to fire her, citing risks to central bank independence and financial stability. A federal judge blocked her removal, noting the 1913 law allows governors to be ousted only “for cause” while in office. Cook denies Trump’s mortgage fraud allegations. Eighteen former Fed chairs and Treasury officials also urged the Court to uphold her protection. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01998272-77a2-711c-87fe-f28ba350981d]
4. 【Fed’s Daly: A Little More Rate Cutting Will Be Needed Over Time】- U.S. economy is in “okay” shape.<br/>- Rates remain modestly restrictive; Fed should not go all the way to neutral as it would be too risky.<br/>- Fed is in a “tradeoff” space, balancing economic growth and inflation risks.<br/>- Inflation impact of tariffs has been smaller than expected, but labor market effects have been larger.<br/>- Fed must monitor both inflation and labor market for potential weakness.

6. 【Intel Eyes TSMC Partnership in U.S.-Backed Comeback】Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is pursuing investments and manufacturing partnerships with Apple, TSMC, and others following the U.S. government’s 10% stake acquisition. SoftBank invested $2 billion in August, while Nvidia contributed $5 billion, including a provision for Intel to design hardware compatible with Nvidia chips. Despite a $3.7 billion loss in H1 2025, Intel may seek additional capital from private equity and institutional investors. Tan emphasized national security, maintaining separation between design and fabrication: “building a firewall between its design and fabrication businesses to encourage customers that design their own chips and entrust Intel with making them.” [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01998247-05cc-711c-87fe-8239cddc82c0]
7. 【Big Tech Raises Hundreds of Billions via Debt to Fuel AI Expansion】Technology firms are executing record debt deals to fund AI infrastructure, with U.S. tech companies issuing ~$157B in public bonds this year, up 70% from 2024. <b>Oracle led with nearly $26B</b>, including an $18B investment-grade bond sale to power data centers with Nvidia chips for OpenAI. Broadcom, Alphabet, and Apple raised tens of billions, while Facebook’s parent secured $29B in private credit. <b>Investor demand has pushed spreads to near 27-year lows</b>, with some bonds maturing in 40 years. Analysts highlight risks and funding challenges: Johnathan Owen (TwentyFour Asset Management) said, “The AI investment boom…is now spilling into credit.” Matt Gannon (Barclays) noted, “The investable dollars into tech are dwarfing other sectors.” John Sales (Goldman Sachs) added, “A big way to help fund some of those capex needs is via debt on the balance sheet.” <b>An MIT study found 95% of companies implementing AI pilots saw no return</b>, and Bain & Co. forecasts AI firms could fall $800B short of funds needed for 2030 computing demand.

11. 【AI Stock Pullback Weighs on Market as Oracle, Tech Giants Slide】The S&P 500 fell for a third straight day Thursday, led by weakness in major tech names. <b>Oracle dropped after Rothschild & Co. Redburn issued a sell rating, projecting a 40% decline. </b>Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft also retreated this week. Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said AI stocks appear “extremely overextended” and warned a seasonal pullback could serve as a market reset. She advised profit-taking as market breadth deteriorates, though she sees upside in Intel, which rallied 7% Thursday after reports it approached Apple for investment, extending its year-to-date gain to 66%.

12. 【Fed's Goolsbee: Holding Rates Steady When Inflation Is Rising Cuts Real Rate】- Everyone at FOMC takes their jobs seriously; decisions not driven by politics.<br/>- Fed policy has been mildly restrictive; recent 25bps cut was appropriate.<br/>- Fed projections are not rate-path guidance.<br/>- Pace of rate cuts largely determined by inflation behavior.<br/>- Concerned about inflation; want to remain vigilant.<br/>- With inflation above target, holding rates steady effectively cuts real rates.<br/>- Comfortable with gradual rate cuts if inflation trends toward 2%.<br/>- Frontloading rate cuts before inflation clarity risks a mistake.<br/>- Labor market largely stable with mild cooling.<br/>- New labor market measures not a critique of BLS; values BLS data.<br/>- Optimistic tariffs won’t broadly raise inflation; rates can come down.<br/>- Drop in immigration could normally raise inflation.<br/>- Fed president reappointments remain merit-based; no expected change.
