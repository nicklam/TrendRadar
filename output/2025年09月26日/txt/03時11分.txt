1. 【Big Tech Raises Hundreds of Billions via Debt to Fuel AI Expansion】Technology firms are executing record debt deals to fund AI infrastructure, with U.S. tech companies issuing ~$157B in public bonds this year, up 70% from 2024. <b>Oracle led with nearly $26B</b>, including an $18B investment-grade bond sale to power data centers with Nvidia chips for OpenAI. Broadcom, Alphabet, and Apple raised tens of billions, while Facebook’s parent secured $29B in private credit. <b>Investor demand has pushed spreads to near 27-year lows</b>, with some bonds maturing in 40 years. Analysts highlight risks and funding challenges: Johnathan Owen (TwentyFour Asset Management) said, “The AI investment boom…is now spilling into credit.” Matt Gannon (Barclays) noted, “The investable dollars into tech are dwarfing other sectors.” John Sales (Goldman Sachs) added, “A big way to help fund some of those capex needs is via debt on the balance sheet.” <b>An MIT study found 95% of companies implementing AI pilots saw no return</b>, and Bain & Co. forecasts AI firms could fall $800B short of funds needed for 2030 computing demand.

2. 【Crypto Liquidations Approach $1 Billion Amid Sharp Market Drop】Major cryptocurrencies plunged Thursday, with over $930 million in positions liquidated in 24 hours, according to CoinGlass. Bitcoin fell nearly 4% to below $109,700, Ethereum dropped 7.5% to $3,879, and Dogecoin slid close to 9% to $0.23. Solana also declined nearly 9% to $196. Over $860 million of liquidated positions were long bets. Both SOL and DOGE are down roughly 21% over the past week, making them the largest weekly losers among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, coinciding with declines in U.S. equities.

3. 【Fed's Logan: Time Has Come to Prepare for New Benchmark Rate】- Fed shouldn’t use administered targets for the new system.<br/>- Repo market is the center of money markets, making it a logical target.<br/>- Fed has revised its rate control system multiple times in the past.<br/>- Calls for an overhaul of the central bank’s rate control toolkit.<br/>- Recommends moving to target the tri-party general collateral rate.<br/>- Best to update the system when markets are calm.<br/>- Modernizing the rate control system is technical in nature.<br/>- Fed funds market still works but is increasingly fragile.<br/>- Time has arrived to modernize the interest rate target system.<br/>- Some volatility in the repo rate target is acceptable within the Fed’s range.<br/>- Shift to secured markets necessitates updating the rate target system.

4. 【AI Stock Pullback Weighs on Market as Oracle, Tech Giants Slide】The S&P 500 fell for a third straight day Thursday, led by weakness in major tech names. <b>Oracle dropped after Rothschild & Co. Redburn issued a sell rating, projecting a 40% decline. </b>Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft also retreated this week. Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said AI stocks appear “extremely overextended” and warned a seasonal pullback could serve as a market reset. She advised profit-taking as market breadth deteriorates, though she sees upside in Intel, which rallied 7% Thursday after reports it approached Apple for investment, extending its year-to-date gain to 66%.

5. 【Fed's Goolsbee: Holding Rates Steady When Inflation Is Rising Cuts Real Rate】- Everyone at FOMC takes their jobs seriously; decisions not driven by politics.<br/>- Fed policy has been mildly restrictive; recent 25bps cut was appropriate.<br/>- Fed projections are not rate-path guidance.<br/>- Pace of rate cuts largely determined by inflation behavior.<br/>- Concerned about inflation; want to remain vigilant.<br/>- With inflation above target, holding rates steady effectively cuts real rates.<br/>- Comfortable with gradual rate cuts if inflation trends toward 2%.<br/>- Frontloading rate cuts before inflation clarity risks a mistake.<br/>- Labor market largely stable with mild cooling.<br/>- New labor market measures not a critique of BLS; values BLS data.<br/>- Optimistic tariffs won’t broadly raise inflation; rates can come down.<br/>- Drop in immigration could normally raise inflation.<br/>- Fed president reappointments remain merit-based; no expected change.
