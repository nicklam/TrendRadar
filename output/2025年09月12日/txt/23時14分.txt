1. 【Apple Delays iPhone Air Launch in China Pending Regulatory Approval】Apple Inc. has delayed the launch of its new iPhone Air in mainland China due to pending regulatory approval. When pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple’s China website did not allow purchases of the thinner device, instead displaying a notice that release details would be updated once approval is granted. The company had previously scheduled pre-orders for Sept. 12 and general availability for Sept. 19, in line with the US and other markets.<br/>Unlike in the US, where eSIM technology is widely adopted, China largely relies on physical SIM cards. Because the iPhone Air’s slimmer design supports only eSIM, Apple initially limited availability to China Unicom, requiring customers to activate the device in carrier stores. The company has indicated that China Mobile and China Telecom will eventually support the model.<br/>Apple’s other new iPhones — the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max — launched in China as planned and include physical SIM cards for the local market.

7. 【Gemini Raises $425M in IPO, Valued at $3.33B as Crypto Market Gains Momentum】Cryptocurrency firm Gemini Space Station raised $425 million in an initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday, selling 15.2 million shares at $28 each, above the marketed range of $24 to $26, valuing the company at $3.33 billion on a non-diluted basis. The IPO proceeds were capped at $425 million despite demand exceeding available shares by over 20 times, reflecting strong investor interest. Nasdaq committed $50 million in a private placement during the IPO, and Gemini will begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker "GEMI" on Friday. The crypto IPO market has gained momentum, with recent listings like Figure Technology's $787.5 million IPO and offerings from Circle and Bullish earlier this year. Regulatory wins and high digital asset prices have boosted the sector, though Gemini is still addressing an unresolved SEC lawsuit over its cryptocurrency asset lending program. A status report on the case is due September 15. Additionally, Tyler Winklevoss was accused of lobbying against a Commodity Futures Trading Commission nominee connected to the Trump administration.

8. 【Chinese Investors Pump Record $26 Billion Into Hong Kong ETFs Driven by AI and Biotech Boom】Chinese investors have poured a record $26 billion into locally listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Hong Kong stocks in 2025, driven by hot themes like artificial intelligence, biotech, and youthful consumerism. The Hang Seng Index has surged 30% this year, outperforming China’s CSI 300 Index, with key contributors including Alibaba, Xiaomi, and Pop Mart International. Retail investors are drawn to sector-specific ETFs, such as Fullgoal CSI Hong Kong Connect Internet ETF and China Universal CNI HK Connect Innovative Drug ETF, for thematic exposure, facilitated by easy access through apps like Alipay without needing securities accounts. Analysts attribute the inflows to Hong Kong’s unique sectoral stories, strong returns, and the rapid rollout of niche ETFs, with 17 new Hong Kong equity ETFs launched in China this year and 16 more in the pipeline. Despite representing only 10% of China's ETF market, Hong Kong equity funds have attracted over 50% of total inflows, offering a convenient alternative to cross-border trading, which requires higher account balances.
