10. 【China Mulls Helping Local Governments With $1 Trillion of Bills: Bloomberg】China is planning to address a massive backlog of unpaid bills owed by local governments to private sector companies, with arrears estimated at over $1 trillion. The government is considering directing state lenders and policy banks, such as China Development Bank, to provide loans to local authorities to settle at least 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in overdue payments in the first phase of a longer-term initiative, aiming for completion by 2027. Government has highlighted the issue’s urgency, warning that delayed payments threaten business viability and public trust. Local government-related entities are estimated to owe around 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion), or 7% of China’s GDP, to corporates and civil servants. Authorities have instructed major banks to offer short-term liquidity loans to help regional governments repay affiliated entities’ debts, though banks are concerned about rising risks and require regulatory assurances. Chinese banks, already facing record-low margins and increasing bad loans, set aside 3.51 trillion yuan in allowances for loan losses in the first half of this year, up nearly 6% from year-end 2023.
