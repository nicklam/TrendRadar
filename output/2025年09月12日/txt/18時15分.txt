3. 【Gemini Raises $425M in IPO, Valued at $3.33B as Crypto Market Gains Momentum】Cryptocurrency firm Gemini Space Station raised $425 million in an initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday, selling 15.2 million shares at $28 each, above the marketed range of $24 to $26, valuing the company at $3.33 billion on a non-diluted basis. The IPO proceeds were capped at $425 million despite demand exceeding available shares by over 20 times, reflecting strong investor interest. Nasdaq committed $50 million in a private placement during the IPO, and Gemini will begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker "GEMI" on Friday. The crypto IPO market has gained momentum, with recent listings like Figure Technology's $787.5 million IPO and offerings from Circle and Bullish earlier this year. Regulatory wins and high digital asset prices have boosted the sector, though Gemini is still addressing an unresolved SEC lawsuit over its cryptocurrency asset lending program. A status report on the case is due September 15. Additionally, Tyler Winklevoss was accused of lobbying against a Commodity Futures Trading Commission nominee connected to the Trump administration.

4. 【Chinese Investors Pump Record $26 Billion Into Hong Kong ETFs Driven by AI and Biotech Boom】Chinese investors have poured a record $26 billion into locally listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Hong Kong stocks in 2025, driven by hot themes like artificial intelligence, biotech, and youthful consumerism. The Hang Seng Index has surged 30% this year, outperforming China’s CSI 300 Index, with key contributors including Alibaba, Xiaomi, and Pop Mart International. Retail investors are drawn to sector-specific ETFs, such as Fullgoal CSI Hong Kong Connect Internet ETF and China Universal CNI HK Connect Innovative Drug ETF, for thematic exposure, facilitated by easy access through apps like Alipay without needing securities accounts. Analysts attribute the inflows to Hong Kong’s unique sectoral stories, strong returns, and the rapid rollout of niche ETFs, with 17 new Hong Kong equity ETFs launched in China this year and 16 more in the pipeline. Despite representing only 10% of China's ETF market, Hong Kong equity funds have attracted over 50% of total inflows, offering a convenient alternative to cross-border trading, which requires higher account balances.
