4. 【Fed’s Collins: “Prudent” to Cut Rates Amid Lower Inflation, Job Risks】<b>Economic Growth & Labor Market<br/></b>- Expects <b>more economic growth</b>.<br/>- Anticipates a <b>small rise in unemployment</b>.<br/>- Notes <b>downside risks to the job market</b> have increased.<br/><b>Monetary Policy Stance<br/></b>- Even with easing, policy would remain “mildly restrictive.”<br/>- <b>Policy is not on a pre-set path; some scenarios could keep rates steady.</b><br/>- Considers it “<b>prudent</b>” to cut rates further given lower inflation risks and job market concerns.<br/><b>Inflation & Tariffs<br/></b>- Inflation risks have become more contained.<br/>- <b>Tariffs will continue to push up prices in the near term</b>.<br/>- Inflation should begin to ease as tariff impact wanes.<br/><b>Financial Conditions<br/></b>- Favorable financial conditions are expected to support households.

5. 【Former Fed Economist Says October Rate Cut Is Certain】- <b>Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and former Fed economist, </b>said that<b> a rate cut in October is effectively certain,</b> noting that nothing has changed the view that downside risks to the labor market remain. <br/>- <b>Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior US economist at the Conference Board</b>, commented that<b> risks to the employment side of the Fed’s mandate are rising</b>, which she expects to drive near-term policy decisions. <br/>- <b>Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG</b>, highlighted that the <b>division among Fed policymakers regarding the number of rate cuts next year</b> signals uncertainty about the longer-term path for rates, which contributes to Powell’s cautious stance.

6. 【Market Experts: Powell Signals Rate Cuts, But Broader Market Drivers Remain Key】<b>Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at Spartan Capital Securities,</b> said Powell is preparing markets for potential rate cuts while balancing the narrative of economic strength with labor market weakness. Cardillo noted that <b>Powell may implement a 25-basis-point cut at the end of October and could consider a 50-basis-point “jumbo cut” in December if the labor market worsens. </b>He emphasized that Powell is <b>using labor market weakness as a hedge </b>to prevent markets from assuming rate cuts are automatic.<br/><b>Michael James, Equity Sales Trader at Rosenblatt Securities, </b>commented that Powell’s remarks are unlikely to have a major direct impact on the market. He argued that <b>market sentiment and positioning, along with the upcoming third-quarter tech earnings season, will have a larger influence than Powell’s comments</b>. James added that<b> bulls remain dominant</b>, and broader market factors will outweigh Fed commentary in shaping near-term market direction.

7. 【Fed Analysts’ Take on Powell’s Dovish Signals】<b>Chris G. Collins, Bloomberg Economics<br/></b>- Powell may stick to the two-cut path from September; employment and inflation outlooks are largely unchanged. Collins expects 25-bp moves at the final two meetings, a dovish path focused on labor risks, with Powell unlikely to strongly signal an October cut. Alternative data show tariff-exposed goods fell in September, keeping CPI soft enough for cuts.<br/><b>Ira Jersey, Bloomberg Intelligence<br/></b>- Repo levels show abundant reserves but tightening in money markets signals when QT may end. Adding T-bills wouldn’t mimic QE curve effects; policy expectations drive the Treasury curve. Balance-sheet runoff could end in coming months, with reserves near the $2.65T comfortable level. Paying interest on reserves remains necessary; elimination of IOR isn’t on the current reform agenda.<br/><b>Will Hoffman & Ira Jersey, Bloomberg Intelligence (Rates Strategy)<br/></b>- Powell likely won’t deviate from prior FOMC messages; Fed was only modestly dovish, giving no clear path for rate cuts.<br/><b>Gisela Young & Jason Williams, Citigroup<br/></b>- Balance-sheet runoff expected through mid-2026, with reserves around $2.7–$2.8T and effective fed funds near IOR levels.<br/><b>John Briggs, Natixis North America<br/></b>- October cut remains on the table; high hurdle to change.<br/><b>Ed Al-Hussainy, Columbia Threadneedle<br/></b>- Balance-sheet signals boost swap spreads; Powell aligns with Waller/Bowman on labor weakness, largely priced in for 2025.<br/><b>John Brady, RJ O’Brien<br/>- </b>Without current data, Powell unlikely to shift market expectations.

8. 【Powell Defends Fed Balance Sheet and IOR Authority: Nick Timiraos】Powell's speech on the balance sheet does a few things:<br/> 1) It marks to market the current outlook for QT given recent signs of firming in various overnight lending rates.<br/>2) It pushes back against recent criticism (see Bessent et al) that the 2020 pandemic support—measures undertaken at the time with broad backing from Congress and the first Trump administration—represented an outrageous policy foray. Powell concedes (as he has before) that stopping QE sooner would have looked smarter but wouldn't have made a meaningful macroeconomic difference given how quickly and sharply the Fed reversed course in 2022. <br/>3) It also defends against efforts by populist senators in both parties to strip the Fed of the ability to pay IOR by warning that revoking the policy tool could be far more disruptive to markets.

9. 【Fed’s Powell Signals Balance Sheet Drawdown Nearing】<b>Balance Sheet & Monetary Tools:<br/></b>- Balance sheet remains an important monetary policy tool.<br/>- Current Fed policy toolkit working very well.<br/>- Fed still aims for Treasury-only balance sheet over longer run.<br/>- Officials will discuss balance sheet composition.<br/>- Space exists to be more nimble with balance sheet size.<br/>- Stopping balance sheet expansion sooner would have had small impact.<br/>- End of balance sheet drawdown may be approaching in coming months.<br/>- Balance-sheet normalization doesn’t mean returning to smaller pre-pandemic size.<br/>- Stripping Fed of interest-paying powers would complicate rate control.<br/>- Ample reserves regime has proven highly effective.<br/><b>Interest Rates & Policy Path:<br/></b>- Fed losses do not affect monetary policy; profits will return eventually.<br/>- Future monetary policy driven by data and risk assessments.<br/>- Right now there is no “risk-free” path for monetary policy.<br/>- September rate cut justified by rising risks to job market.<br/>- Payroll gains have slowed sharply.<br/><b>Economic Data & Labor Market:<br/></b>- Recent data points to low-hire, low-fire employment landscape.<br/>- Downside risks to U.S. job market have risen.<br/>- Data before U.S. government shutdown suggested growth may be better than expected.<br/>- Available data show tariffs pushing up price pressures.<br/>- Goods price increases primarily reflect tariffs, not broad inflation.<br/><b>Liquidity & Market Conditions:<br/></b>- Some signs of tighter liquidity conditions in parts of money markets.<br/>- Fed can be more nimble in use of balance sheet.<br/>- Data in hand suggest current economy is similar to September.

10. 【Fed’s Bowman Expects Two More Rate Cuts in 2025】Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said she expects the U.S. central bank to deliver two additional interest rate cuts at its final policy meetings of 2025. Bowman supported last month’s quarter-point reduction to 4.00%-4.25%, its first cut since December. “As long as we see the labor market and other economic data evolving in the way that I expect, then we will continue on a path for lowering the federal funds rate,” she said. Bowman, joined by Fed Governor Christopher Waller in dissenting at July’s meeting, argued that tariffs since Trump’s return will not create persistent inflation, with risks tilted toward the job market.
