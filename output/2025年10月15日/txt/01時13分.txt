1. 【Powell Defends Fed Balance Sheet and IOR Authority: Nick Timiraos】Powell's speech on the balance sheet does a few things:<br/> 1) It marks to market the current outlook for QT given recent signs of firming in various overnight lending rates.<br/>2) It pushes back against recent criticism (see Bessent et al) that the 2020 pandemic support—measures undertaken at the time with broad backing from Congress and the first Trump administration—represented an outrageous policy foray. Powell concedes (as he has before) that stopping QE sooner would have looked smarter but wouldn't have made a meaningful macroeconomic difference given how quickly and sharply the Fed reversed course in 2022. <br/>3) It also defends against efforts by populist senators in both parties to strip the Fed of the ability to pay IOR by warning that revoking the policy tool could be far more disruptive to markets.

2. 【Fed’s Powell Signals Balance Sheet Drawdown Nearing】<b>Balance Sheet & Monetary Tools:<br/></b>- Balance sheet remains an important monetary policy tool.<br/>- Current Fed policy toolkit working very well.<br/>- Fed still aims for Treasury-only balance sheet over longer run.<br/>- Officials will discuss balance sheet composition.<br/>- Space exists to be more nimble with balance sheet size.<br/>- Stopping balance sheet expansion sooner would have had small impact.<br/>- End of balance sheet drawdown may be approaching in coming months.<br/>- Balance-sheet normalization doesn’t mean returning to smaller pre-pandemic size.<br/>- Stripping Fed of interest-paying powers would complicate rate control.<br/>- Ample reserves regime has proven highly effective.<br/><b>Interest Rates & Policy Path:<br/></b>- Fed losses do not affect monetary policy; profits will return eventually.<br/>- Future monetary policy driven by data and risk assessments.<br/>- Right now there is no “risk-free” path for monetary policy.<br/>- September rate cut justified by rising risks to job market.<br/>- Payroll gains have slowed sharply.<br/><b>Economic Data & Labor Market:<br/></b>- Recent data points to low-hire, low-fire employment landscape.<br/>- Downside risks to U.S. job market have risen.<br/>- Data before U.S. government shutdown suggested growth may be better than expected.<br/>- Available data show tariffs pushing up price pressures.<br/>- Goods price increases primarily reflect tariffs, not broad inflation.<br/><b>Liquidity & Market Conditions:<br/></b>- Some signs of tighter liquidity conditions in parts of money markets.<br/>- Fed can be more nimble in use of balance sheet.<br/>- Data in hand suggest current economy is similar to September.

3. 【Fed’s Bowman Expects Two More Rate Cuts in 2025】Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said she expects the U.S. central bank to deliver two additional interest rate cuts at its final policy meetings of 2025. Bowman supported last month’s quarter-point reduction to 4.00%-4.25%, its first cut since December. “As long as we see the labor market and other economic data evolving in the way that I expect, then we will continue on a path for lowering the federal funds rate,” she said. Bowman, joined by Fed Governor Christopher Waller in dissenting at July’s meeting, argued that tariffs since Trump’s return will not create persistent inflation, with risks tilted toward the job market.
