2. 【Analysts Expect Fed Rate Cuts, Potential Impact on Borrowing Costs】- <b>Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan Chase</b>, said that Powell’s remarks “<b>solidified expectations for further rate cuts</b>, starting at its next meeting Oct. 28-29.” He added, “While there was little doubt the (Fed) was angled to cut rates at its next meeting, today’s remarks were <b>strong confirmation of that expectation</b>.”<br/>- <b>Economists at BMO Capital Markets </b>noted that Powell’s signals about <b>potentially ending the Fed’s balance-sheet reduction</b> could <b>slightly lower borrowing costs </b>over time.

3. FED'S COLLINS: PERHAPS ANOTHER 25 BPS OF EASING MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=0199e465-c54b-7771-bdce-475459ea3a2d]
4. 【Fed’s Collins: “Prudent” to Cut Rates Amid Lower Inflation, Job Risks】<b>Economic Growth & Labor Market<br/></b>- Expects <b>more economic growth</b>.<br/>- Anticipates a <b>small rise in unemployment</b>.<br/>- Notes <b>downside risks to the job market</b> have increased.<br/><b>Monetary Policy Stance<br/></b>- Even with easing, policy would remain “mildly restrictive.”<br/>- <b>Policy is not on a pre-set path; some scenarios could keep rates steady.</b><br/>- Considers it “<b>prudent</b>” to cut rates further given lower inflation risks and job market concerns.<br/><b>Inflation & Tariffs<br/></b>- Inflation risks have become more contained.<br/>- <b>Tariffs will continue to push up prices in the near term</b>.<br/>- Inflation should begin to ease as tariff impact wanes.<br/><b>Financial Conditions<br/></b>- Favorable financial conditions are expected to support households.

5. 【Former Fed Economist Says October Rate Cut Is Certain】- <b>Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and former Fed economist, </b>said that<b> a rate cut in October is effectively certain,</b> noting that nothing has changed the view that downside risks to the labor market remain. <br/>- <b>Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior US economist at the Conference Board</b>, commented that<b> risks to the employment side of the Fed’s mandate are rising</b>, which she expects to drive near-term policy decisions. <br/>- <b>Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG</b>, highlighted that the <b>division among Fed policymakers regarding the number of rate cuts next year</b> signals uncertainty about the longer-term path for rates, which contributes to Powell’s cautious stance.

6. 【Market Experts: Powell Signals Rate Cuts, But Broader Market Drivers Remain Key】<b>Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at Spartan Capital Securities,</b> said Powell is preparing markets for potential rate cuts while balancing the narrative of economic strength with labor market weakness. Cardillo noted that <b>Powell may implement a 25-basis-point cut at the end of October and could consider a 50-basis-point “jumbo cut” in December if the labor market worsens. </b>He emphasized that Powell is <b>using labor market weakness as a hedge </b>to prevent markets from assuming rate cuts are automatic.<br/><b>Michael James, Equity Sales Trader at Rosenblatt Securities, </b>commented that Powell’s remarks are unlikely to have a major direct impact on the market. He argued that <b>market sentiment and positioning, along with the upcoming third-quarter tech earnings season, will have a larger influence than Powell’s comments</b>. James added that<b> bulls remain dominant</b>, and broader market factors will outweigh Fed commentary in shaping near-term market direction.

7. 【Fed Analysts’ Take on Powell’s Dovish Signals】<b>Chris G. Collins, Bloomberg Economics<br/></b>- Powell may stick to the two-cut path from September; employment and inflation outlooks are largely unchanged. Collins expects 25-bp moves at the final two meetings, a dovish path focused on labor risks, with Powell unlikely to strongly signal an October cut. Alternative data show tariff-exposed goods fell in September, keeping CPI soft enough for cuts.<br/><b>Ira Jersey, Bloomberg Intelligence<br/></b>- Repo levels show abundant reserves but tightening in money markets signals when QT may end. Adding T-bills wouldn’t mimic QE curve effects; policy expectations drive the Treasury curve. Balance-sheet runoff could end in coming months, with reserves near the $2.65T comfortable level. Paying interest on reserves remains necessary; elimination of IOR isn’t on the current reform agenda.<br/><b>Will Hoffman & Ira Jersey, Bloomberg Intelligence (Rates Strategy)<br/></b>- Powell likely won’t deviate from prior FOMC messages; Fed was only modestly dovish, giving no clear path for rate cuts.<br/><b>Gisela Young & Jason Williams, Citigroup<br/></b>- Balance-sheet runoff expected through mid-2026, with reserves around $2.7–$2.8T and effective fed funds near IOR levels.<br/><b>John Briggs, Natixis North America<br/></b>- October cut remains on the table; high hurdle to change.<br/><b>Ed Al-Hussainy, Columbia Threadneedle<br/></b>- Balance-sheet signals boost swap spreads; Powell aligns with Waller/Bowman on labor weakness, largely priced in for 2025.<br/><b>John Brady, RJ O’Brien<br/>- </b>Without current data, Powell unlikely to shift market expectations.
