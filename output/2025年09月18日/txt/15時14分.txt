1. 【Fed's Message Is Seen as 'Balanced': Jefferies 】Jefferies would describe the Federal Reserve's statement and Chair Jerome Powell's press conference as 'balanced' and the FOMC committee as deeply divided over the macro outlook, says global economist Mohit Kumar in a note. The 2025 dot plot was a bit dovish, with the median projections showing two more rate cuts for this year, he says. However, while the statement acknowledged the recent weakness in the employment data, it also raised concerns that inflation has moved higher, Kumar says. Jefferies prefers having an underweight position in U.S. Treasurys versus German Bunds. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b85-68e4-755e-85e6-557dc0360923]
2. 【Fed Set for Fewer Rate Cuts Than Market Expectations: DBS】The Fed is forecast to deliver two more rate cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, despite market expectations for three cuts in 4Q 2025 and three additional cuts next year, DBS Chief Economist Taimur Baig says. The bank is sticking with its view that the current rate-cut cycle will stall after 100 bps of cuts. U.S. tariffs, labor-market tightness due to an immigration crackdown, tax cuts, strong household and corporate finances, surging AI-related energy demand and an extended rally in equities all trigger inflation risk, Baig notes. Given that inflation pressures are higher now than a year ago, Baig believes the FOMC majority view of a 3.5% terminal rate will not be easy to sway.

3. 【Risk Assets Expected to Benefit From Fed Rate Cut: Moneyfarm】The Federal Reserve's rate cut is likely to boost short-term sentiment for risk assets, with the stock market expected to benefit, says European digital wealth manager Moneyfarm's Richard Flax in a note. For U.S. households and businesses, the Fed's rate cut offers modest relief, but the broader message is one of caution rather than a pivot towards rapid easing, the CIO says. On Wednesday, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to 4.00%-4.25% in a near-unanimous vote. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b6c-57c7-755e-85e5-d6249c9453c9]
4. 【Fed Gives Clear Signal, Takes A Measured Step: Bolvin Wealth Management Group】The Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point cut is a clear signal, says Bolvin Wealth Management Group's President Gina Bolvin in a note. "The softening labor market and stubborn inflation have pushed policymakers to act--but gradually," Bolvin says. This isn't a pivot, it's a measured step, she says. "The Fed is walking a fine line, and upcoming inflation and jobs data will determine what comes next." [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b61-29fc-755e-85e5-9e38f0345d85]
5. 【Fed's Dispersion in Views for 2026 Likely Means More Market Volatility】There was a significant dispersion in policy views by the Fed for 2026, which probably means more volatility in financial markets next year, says Jack McIntyre at Franklin Templeton. The Fed's move was a risk management-style rate cut, and shows that it is putting more emphasis on softening in the labor market, McIntyre says. "It makes sense that more rate cuts are expected as monetary policy works with a lag and labor market statistics are a lagging economic indicator," he says. While markets have already discounted significant Fed easing, the challenge for investors is a Fed that isn't yet willing to endorse their discounted future path of much lower interest rates, says investment strategist Larry Hatheway.

6. 【Fed's Hawkish Stance Strengthens Dollar, Analyst Predicts Short-Term Gold Pullback to $3,600】"The general message from the Fed was slightly to the hawkish side on interest rates, they didn't really enthusiastically endorse lower rates," said Marex analyst Edward Meir. "As a result, we saw the dollar firm up after the Fed meeting and the Treasury rates also moved higher... I think over the short term, we are probably a little bit overbought here and we could retrace a bit further maybe to the $3,600 mark."

7. 【Equities Could Benefit if Fed Strikes Right Balance in Rate-Cut Approach: Allspring Global Investments】Equities could benefit from a "not too much, not too little" approach to easing by the Federal Reserve, says Allspring Global Investments' George Bory and John Campbell in a commentary. Continuing strength in equities and broader market participation could depend on the Fed's ability to strike a balance between providing enough easing to avoid a recession, while keeping inflation under control amid tariff uncertainty, they say. Lower fixed income rates are also likely to renew appeal in higher-yielding equities as a substitute, they add. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b39-d6c1-755e-85e5-2d66f1655529]
8. 【Fed Rate-Cut Outlook Likely Hinges on Soft Labor: BlackRock】The Federal Reserve's rate-cut outlook likely hinges on the labor market staying sufficiently soft, says Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute. Fed Chair Powell said the central bank's latest cut was for "risk management" against growing signs of job market weakness, which may imply that future policy moves will be very data-dependent, says Boivin. He sees possible tensions for the Fed in keeping a lid on inflation and debt-servicing costs, which are dissipating but could easily reignite if rate cuts boost business confidence and hiring. Against that backdrop, a further softening of the labor market would provide cover for more Fed rate cuts, he says. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995afe-af77-755e-85e4-bcb70bb1e88f]
9. 【Detailed Wrap-Up of Fed's First Rate Cut This Year】<b>Key Decision</b>: <br/>- <b>Rate Cut</b>: The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, shifting the federal funds target rate to a range of 4% to 4.25%. <br/>- <b>First Rate Cut Since December</b>: This marks the first reduction in borrowing costs in 2025, ending a prolonged pause. <br/>- <b>Not Unanimous</b>: The decision faced dissent, with Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee sworn in just before the Fed’s meeting, voting for a larger cut of 0.5 percentage points. <br/><br/><b>Reasons for the Rate Cut</b>: <br/>- <b>Labor Market Risks</b>: The Fed acknowledged that downside risks to employment have risen, citing slowing job growth and weaker hiring trends. <br/>- <b>Jobs Data</b>: Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, and July’s payroll numbers were revised downward by 258,000 positions. <br/>- <b>Unemployment Rate</b>: While stable at 4.3%, officials expect it to rise to 4.5% by the end of the year. <br/>- <b>Balancing Inflation</b>: Inflation remains elevated but is showing signs of moderation. The Fed’s dual mandate—low inflation and a healthy labor market—has created tension in decision-making. <br/>- <b>Core Inflation</b>: Predicted to rise to 3.1% by the end of 2025, with expectations for a gradual decline to 2.6% by the end of 2026. Inflation is not expected to return to the Fed’s 2% target until 2028. <br/><br/><b>Economic Context</b>: <br/>- <b>Growth Projections</b>: Officials forecast 1.6% economic growth for 2025, slightly higher than their June estimates. <br/>- <b>Tariff Impact</b>: Higher tariffs, largely paid by importers, are causing one-time price increases but have had slower-than-expected pass-through effects on inflation. <br/>- <b>Labor Force Constraints</b>: Trump’s immigration crackdown has reduced the supply of workers, contributing to the labor market slowdown. <br/><br/><b>Internal Divisions</b>: <br/>- <b>Dissenting Votes</b>: Miran’s vote for a half-point cut highlights divisions within the Fed. Seven of the 19 policymakers projected fewer rate cuts for 2025, suggesting future decisions may be contentious. <br/>- <b>Dot Plot</b>: Projections for 2025 varied widely, with one policymaker favoring rates to remain at 4.25%-4.5% and another suggesting a steep drop to 2.75%-3%. <br/><br/><b>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Remarks</b>: <br/>- <b>Risk Management</b>: Powell described the rate cut as a risk management move, aimed at supporting the economy rather than responding to an economic downturn. <br/>- <b>Focus on Labor Market</b>: Powell emphasized the Fed’s shift toward addressing labor market risks, noting that persistent inflation risks have declined. <br/>- <b>Independence</b>: Powell reiterated the Fed’s commitment to political independence, stating, “Everything we do is in service to our public mission.” <br/><br/><b>Future Rate Path</b>: <br/>- <b>Two More Cuts Expected</b>: Most officials predict two additional quarter-point cuts this year, bringing rates down to 3.5%-3.75%. <br/>- <b>Long-Term Outlook</b>: Rates are expected to decline slightly in 2026 and stabilize just above 3% through 2028.
