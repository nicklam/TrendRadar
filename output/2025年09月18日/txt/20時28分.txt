2. 【Fed's Message Is Seen as 'Balanced': Jefferies 】Jefferies would describe the Federal Reserve's statement and Chair Jerome Powell's press conference as 'balanced' and the FOMC committee as deeply divided over the macro outlook, says global economist Mohit Kumar in a note. The 2025 dot plot was a bit dovish, with the median projections showing two more rate cuts for this year, he says. However, while the statement acknowledged the recent weakness in the employment data, it also raised concerns that inflation has moved higher, Kumar says. Jefferies prefers having an underweight position in U.S. Treasurys versus German Bunds. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b85-68e4-755e-85e6-557dc0360923]
3. 【Fed Set for Fewer Rate Cuts Than Market Expectations: DBS】The Fed is forecast to deliver two more rate cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, despite market expectations for three cuts in 4Q 2025 and three additional cuts next year, DBS Chief Economist Taimur Baig says. The bank is sticking with its view that the current rate-cut cycle will stall after 100 bps of cuts. U.S. tariffs, labor-market tightness due to an immigration crackdown, tax cuts, strong household and corporate finances, surging AI-related energy demand and an extended rally in equities all trigger inflation risk, Baig notes. Given that inflation pressures are higher now than a year ago, Baig believes the FOMC majority view of a 3.5% terminal rate will not be easy to sway.

4. 【Risk Assets Expected to Benefit From Fed Rate Cut: Moneyfarm】The Federal Reserve's rate cut is likely to boost short-term sentiment for risk assets, with the stock market expected to benefit, says European digital wealth manager Moneyfarm's Richard Flax in a note. For U.S. households and businesses, the Fed's rate cut offers modest relief, but the broader message is one of caution rather than a pivot towards rapid easing, the CIO says. On Wednesday, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to 4.00%-4.25% in a near-unanimous vote. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b6c-57c7-755e-85e5-d6249c9453c9]
5. 【Fed Gives Clear Signal, Takes A Measured Step: Bolvin Wealth Management Group】The Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point cut is a clear signal, says Bolvin Wealth Management Group's President Gina Bolvin in a note. "The softening labor market and stubborn inflation have pushed policymakers to act--but gradually," Bolvin says. This isn't a pivot, it's a measured step, she says. "The Fed is walking a fine line, and upcoming inflation and jobs data will determine what comes next." [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b61-29fc-755e-85e5-9e38f0345d85]
6. 【Fed's Dispersion in Views for 2026 Likely Means More Market Volatility】There was a significant dispersion in policy views by the Fed for 2026, which probably means more volatility in financial markets next year, says Jack McIntyre at Franklin Templeton. The Fed's move was a risk management-style rate cut, and shows that it is putting more emphasis on softening in the labor market, McIntyre says. "It makes sense that more rate cuts are expected as monetary policy works with a lag and labor market statistics are a lagging economic indicator," he says. While markets have already discounted significant Fed easing, the challenge for investors is a Fed that isn't yet willing to endorse their discounted future path of much lower interest rates, says investment strategist Larry Hatheway.

7. 【Fed's Hawkish Stance Strengthens Dollar, Analyst Predicts Short-Term Gold Pullback to $3,600】"The general message from the Fed was slightly to the hawkish side on interest rates, they didn't really enthusiastically endorse lower rates," said Marex analyst Edward Meir. "As a result, we saw the dollar firm up after the Fed meeting and the Treasury rates also moved higher... I think over the short term, we are probably a little bit overbought here and we could retrace a bit further maybe to the $3,600 mark."

8. 【Equities Could Benefit if Fed Strikes Right Balance in Rate-Cut Approach: Allspring Global Investments】Equities could benefit from a "not too much, not too little" approach to easing by the Federal Reserve, says Allspring Global Investments' George Bory and John Campbell in a commentary. Continuing strength in equities and broader market participation could depend on the Fed's ability to strike a balance between providing enough easing to avoid a recession, while keeping inflation under control amid tariff uncertainty, they say. Lower fixed income rates are also likely to renew appeal in higher-yielding equities as a substitute, they add. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01995b39-d6c1-755e-85e5-2d66f1655529]
9. 【Fed Rate-Cut Outlook Likely Hinges on Soft Labor: BlackRock】The Federal Reserve's rate-cut outlook likely hinges on the labor market staying sufficiently soft, says Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute. Fed Chair Powell said the central bank's latest cut was for "risk management" against growing signs of job market weakness, which may imply that future policy moves will be very data-dependent, says Boivin. He sees possible tensions for the Fed in keeping a lid on inflation and debt-servicing costs, which are dissipating but could easily reignite if rate cuts boost business confidence and hiring. Against that backdrop, a further softening of the labor market would provide cover for more Fed rate cuts, he says.
