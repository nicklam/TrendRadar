1. 【Detailed Wrap-Up of Fed's First Rate Cut This Year】<b>Key Decision</b>: <br/>- <b>Rate Cut</b>: The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, shifting the federal funds target rate to a range of 4% to 4.25%. <br/>- <b>First Rate Cut Since December</b>: This marks the first reduction in borrowing costs in 2025, ending a prolonged pause. <br/>- <b>Not Unanimous</b>: The decision faced dissent, with Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee sworn in just before the Fed’s meeting, voting for a larger cut of 0.5 percentage points. <br/><br/><b>Reasons for the Rate Cut</b>: <br/>- <b>Labor Market Risks</b>: The Fed acknowledged that downside risks to employment have risen, citing slowing job growth and weaker hiring trends. <br/>- <b>Jobs Data</b>: Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, and July’s payroll numbers were revised downward by 258,000 positions. <br/>- <b>Unemployment Rate</b>: While stable at 4.3%, officials expect it to rise to 4.5% by the end of the year. <br/>- <b>Balancing Inflation</b>: Inflation remains elevated but is showing signs of moderation. The Fed’s dual mandate—low inflation and a healthy labor market—has created tension in decision-making. <br/>- <b>Core Inflation</b>: Predicted to rise to 3.1% by the end of 2025, with expectations for a gradual decline to 2.6% by the end of 2026. Inflation is not expected to return to the Fed’s 2% target until 2028. <br/><br/><b>Economic Context</b>: <br/>- <b>Growth Projections</b>: Officials forecast 1.6% economic growth for 2025, slightly higher than their June estimates. <br/>- <b>Tariff Impact</b>: Higher tariffs, largely paid by importers, are causing one-time price increases but have had slower-than-expected pass-through effects on inflation. <br/>- <b>Labor Force Constraints</b>: Trump’s immigration crackdown has reduced the supply of workers, contributing to the labor market slowdown. <br/><br/><b>Internal Divisions</b>: <br/>- <b>Dissenting Votes</b>: Miran’s vote for a half-point cut highlights divisions within the Fed. Seven of the 19 policymakers projected fewer rate cuts for 2025, suggesting future decisions may be contentious. <br/>- <b>Dot Plot</b>: Projections for 2025 varied widely, with one policymaker favoring rates to remain at 4.25%-4.5% and another suggesting a steep drop to 2.75%-3%. <br/><br/><b>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Remarks</b>: <br/>- <b>Risk Management</b>: Powell described the rate cut as a risk management move, aimed at supporting the economy rather than responding to an economic downturn. <br/>- <b>Focus on Labor Market</b>: Powell emphasized the Fed’s shift toward addressing labor market risks, noting that persistent inflation risks have declined. <br/>- <b>Independence</b>: Powell reiterated the Fed’s commitment to political independence, stating, “Everything we do is in service to our public mission.” <br/><br/><b>Future Rate Path</b>: <br/>- <b>Two More Cuts Expected</b>: Most officials predict two additional quarter-point cuts this year, bringing rates down to 3.5%-3.75%. <br/>- <b>Long-Term Outlook</b>: Rates are expected to decline slightly in 2026 and stabilize just above 3% through 2028.
