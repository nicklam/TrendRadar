3. 【Chinese Tech Giants Defy Pressure, Eye Nvidia’s AI Chips, Sources Say】Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent and other Chinese tech firms remain eager to secure Nvidia’s AI chips despite Beijing discouraging such purchases, four people with knowledge of procurement discussions said, with companies seeking reassurance on H20 orders and closely monitoring plans for the more powerful B30A chip, which could cost twice as much but deliver up to six times the performance. Both models are tailored to comply with U.S. export restrictions, underscoring the broader U.S.-China tech rivalry; Washington has allowed H20 sales while striking a deal to receive 15% of related revenue, and Chinese regulators have questioned firms over purchases without banning them. Demand in China remains strong as domestic alternatives from Huawei and Cambricon face supply and performance limits, though Nvidia’s unclear prospects there have weighed on its sales outlook and share price. Still, with up to 700,000 H20 chips in inventory, plans to deliver B30A samples as early as September, and CEO Jensen Huang estimating a $50 billion China market if competitive access continues, Nvidia is working to reassure customers and protect its foothold.

4. 【Hong Kong Treasury Chief: Airport Storage to Expand to 1,000 Tons to Support Spot Gold Trading】Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, stated in his blog that Hong Kong's institutional advantages and strategic location provide unique conditions for developing its gold market. <b>Since efforts to establish Hong Kong as a gold trading hub began, significant progress has been made across various areas. Hui revealed that the Airport Authority has increased the storage capacity of precious metals at Hong Kong International Airport by one-third to 200 metric tons, with plans to expand it in phases to 1,000 metric tons, providing strong support for spot gold trading, delivery, and logistics in Hong Kong.</b><br/>Another milestone is the Shanghai Gold Exchange’s launch of its designated warehouse for the International Board in Hong Kong in June 2025, along with gold contracts settled in Hong Kong. This marks the first time the exchange has set up an offshore delivery warehouse, offering international investors RMB-denominated, offshore-settled trading options, while further strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a core offshore RMB market. Hui emphasized that Hong Kong is actively leveraging opportunities in gold investment. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=0199132d-d279-799d-bd73-bbd496f55a4e]
5. 【Goldman Sachs Predicts Gold Could Reach $5,000 as Fed Credibility Weakens】Goldman Sachs predicts gold could rally to nearly $5,000 an ounce if the Federal Reserve’s credibility is damaged, prompting investors to shift 1% of privately-owned US Treasury holdings into bullion. Analysts, including Samantha Dart, warn that compromised Fed independence could lead to higher inflation, weaker stocks and bonds, and erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status, while gold remains a reliable store of value. Goldman’s baseline forecast sees gold surging to $4,000 by mid-2026, with a tail-risk scenario of $4,500. Gold has already risen over a third this year, hitting a record high, driven by central-bank accumulation, expectations of lower US interest rates, and President Trump’s efforts to assert control over the Fed, including attempts to remove Governor Lisa Cook. Goldman maintains gold as its top commodity recommendation. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=019912f3-5cda-799d-bd73-41b0000d0a93]
6. 【Ukraine’s Parliament Backs Crypto Legalization, Taxation Bill in First Reading: Cointelegraph】Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed the first reading of a bill to legalize and tax cryptocurrency with 246 votes in favor, as announced by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak. The proposed legislation includes an 18% income tax and a 5% military tax on digital asset profits, alongside a preferential 5% tax rate for fiat conversions during the first year. The bill aligns with Ukraine's financial regulator’s April recommendation, exempting crypto-to-crypto and stablecoin transactions, potentially positioning the country closer to crypto-friendly jurisdictions.

9. 【China Weighs Curbs on Stock Speculation to Foster Steady Gains】China’s financial regulators are weighing a series of cooling measures for the stock market as they become increasingly concerned about the speed of a $1.2 trillion rally that began in August, according to sources familiar with the matter. Among the proposals discussed with top policymakers in recent weeks are the removal of certain short selling restrictions and the introduction of options to curb speculative trading, due to worries that a sudden market reversal could cause significant losses for retail investors. The Shanghai Composite Index has reached its highest level in a decade, while the CSI 300 Index has climbed more than 20% from its lowest point this year. Regulators have already mobilized financial institutions to support market stability, instructing banks to investigate the illegal use of credit funds for stock investments after discovering that some investors were using money borrowed from online credit platforms. Brokerages have been ordered not to aggressively promote their 24-hour services for opening new stock accounts, as data shows retail investors opened 166% more new accounts in August compared to the same period last year. Additionally, social media platforms have been warned against heavily publicizing bullish market content, margin trading milestones, and the shift of bank deposits into stocks to avoid attracting inexperienced investors. Authorities have stated that any violations or illegal stock recommendations will face severe punishment. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has not commented on the potential measures. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01991257-b8d4-799d-bd71-9522007dc508]
