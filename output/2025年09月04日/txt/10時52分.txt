2. 【China Weighs Curbs on Stock Speculation to Foster Steady Gains】China’s financial regulators are weighing a series of cooling measures for the stock market as they become increasingly concerned about the speed of a $1.2 trillion rally that began in August, according to sources familiar with the matter. Among the proposals discussed with top policymakers in recent weeks are the removal of certain short selling restrictions and the introduction of options to curb speculative trading, due to worries that a sudden market reversal could cause significant losses for retail investors. The Shanghai Composite Index has reached its highest level in a decade, while the CSI 300 Index has climbed more than 20% from its lowest point this year. Regulators have already mobilized financial institutions to support market stability, instructing banks to investigate the illegal use of credit funds for stock investments after discovering that some investors were using money borrowed from online credit platforms. Brokerages have been ordered not to aggressively promote their 24-hour services for opening new stock accounts, as data shows retail investors opened 166% more new accounts in August compared to the same period last year. Additionally, social media platforms have been warned against heavily publicizing bullish market content, margin trading milestones, and the shift of bank deposits into stocks to avoid attracting inexperienced investors. Authorities have stated that any violations or illegal stock recommendations will face severe punishment. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has not commented on the potential measures. [URL:https://mktnews.net/flashDetail.html?id=01991257-b8d4-799d-bd71-9522007dc508]
